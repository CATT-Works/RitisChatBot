	<h2>DiTTlab</h2>
<p>
Speed — The current estimated harmonic mean speed for the roadway segment in miles per hour.
</p>

<p>
Reference Speed — The calculated "free flow" mean speed for the roadway segment in miles per hour.
This attribute is calculated based upon the 85th-percentile point of the
observed speeds on that segment for all time periods, which establishes a reliable proxy for the speed
of traffic at free-flow for that segment.
</p>

<h3>Metadata fields</h3>

These fields are associated with each segment:
<ul>
  

<li>datasource - the data set this record comes from. This field is only included in Massive Data Downloader exports when choosing to merge the data sets into a single CSV file.</li>
<li>tmc - the unique 9-digit value identifying the TMC segment.</li>
<li>road - the route number or common name of the roadway</li>
<li>direction - the overall direction of the roadway</li>
<li>intersection - the cross street and/or interchange associated with the TMC segment</li>
<li>state - the postal abbreviation of the state to which the TMC Segment is assigned</li>
<li>miles - the length of the TMC segment</li>
<li>road_order - a numerical value indicating in what order the TMC segment would be encountered when traveling downstream relative to the other TMC segments on the same road</li>
<li>start_latitude - the latitude of the beginning of the TMC segment</li>
<li>start_longitude - the longitude of the beginning of the TMC segment</li>
<li>end_latitude - the latitude of the end of the TMC segment</li>
<li>end_longitude - the longitude of the end of the TMC segment</li>
<li>tmclinear - a reference to the "Linear TMC" that includes the TMC Segment. 
  Typically, several TMC Segments are part of a Linear TMC, which usually represents a road corridor through a single county.
  The purpose of this column is to provide assistance for filtering and locating TMC Segments and simplifying the process of linking consecutive TMC Segments.</li>
<li>type - the type of tmc code. "P1" is the typical TMC Code. "P3" indicates national, state, and county boundaries, rest areas, toll plazas, major bridges, etc. "P4" is for ramps.</li>
<li>country - the country in which the TMC segment is located</li>
</ul>

<p>

<b>Speed</b> — Speed is recorded in mph as an integer. The harmonic average speed for all reporting vehicles on the segment.
<p>
<b>Average speed</b> — The historical average speed.
Historical average speeds are calculated by the CATT Lab by taking the harmonic average of speeds on each segment for each hour of day and for each day of the week.
For data from February 1, 2017 onward, this historical average speed is calculated over the period of February 1, 2017 - June 30th, 2017.
For data prior to February 1, 2017, the average is calculated using the twelve-month period preceding November 2014.
</p>
<p>
<b>Reference speed</b> — An approximation of free-flow speed for the segment.
This value is calculated by the CATT Lab using the 95th percentile of the speeds between 10 PM and 5 AM.
The reference speed is calculated over a 6-month period starting April 1st, 2017 - September 30th, 2017.
</p>
<p>
<b>Travel Time</b> — Travel time recorded in minutes or seconds. It is the ratio between the segment length and the harmonic average speed for all reporting vehicles on the segment.
</p>
<p>
<b>Data Density</b> — refers to one of three values.
</p>
<ul class="tight">
  <li><b>A</b>:	Fewer than five values</li>
  <li><b>B</b>:	Five to nine values</li>
  <li><b>C</b>:	More than nine values</li>

<h3>HPMS metadata fields</h3>

The following attributes are integrated from FHWA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). The
HPMS is currently based on roadway centerlines and therefore the integrated HPMS attributes represent
BOTH TRAVEL DIRECTIONS, whereas each TMC segment represents a particular direction of travel. NPMRDS
users may need to adjust some HPMS centerline-based attributes (such as AADT and number of through lanes)
accordingly for certain applications. HPMS attributes and codes are defined in detail in Chapter 4 of the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/fieldmanual/" target="_blank">December 2016 HPMS Field Manual</a>.

<h2>Providing Your Signal Data</h2>

<p>
Travel Time Delta Ranking and Travel Time Comparison work most effectively when data for speed limits and traffic signals are provided.  This document describes the content and formats for providing this data to the CATT Lab.
If you'd like to provide traffic signal data for use in these tools, please send the data described below to <a href="mailto:intake@ritis.org">intake@ritis.org</a>, or contact us if you have any questions about providing this data.
</p>

<h3>Speed Limit Data</h3>
<p>
Travel Time Comparison and Travel Time Delta Ranking work most effectively when we have speed limit data for each XD segment.   However, data is not required: for any XD segment without a speed limit value (whether individual segments or an entire region), we use the segment reference speed (from the probe provider) as a fallback.
</p>

<h4>Required Fields</h4>
<ul>
  <li>XD segment ID (integer)</li>
  <li>Speed Limit (integer)</li>
</ul>
<span class="italic">(There are no optional fields.)</span>
<h4>File Format</h4>
<p>
Please provide data in CSV, XML, Excel, or JSON.
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Traffic Signal Data</h3>
<p>
Traffic signal data is not required to use Travel Time Comparison or Travel Time Delta Ranking, but it is required to display traffic signal icons and popup information.
</p>
<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/traffic-signal-tooltip.png" alt="traffic signal tooltip screenshot">
</p>
<h4>Required Fields</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Latitude (number with 4 or more decimal places)</li>
  <li>Longitude (number with 4 or more decimal places)</li>
  <li>Signal ID(s) used for inventory or management (text)</li>
</ul>
<p>
With these values, we can plot traffic signal icons on the map.  In addition, we can provide a popup containing additional, optional fields.
</p>
<h4>Optional Fields</h4>
<p>
Suggested values include
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Primary road (text)</li>
  <li>Secondary road (text)</li>
  <li>District, Region, County, and/or Municipality (text)</li>
  <li>Other parameters used to identify or describe signals (format as appropriate)</li>
</ul>
<h4>File Format</h4>

<h2>Providing Your Volume Data</h2>

<p>Agencies wishing to provide additional volume data to help improve the accuracy of volume data available for their state in the Probe Data Analytics Suite can arrange for the transfer of their data to the University of Maryland CATT Lab.  Please contact the CATT Lab at intake@ritis.org to arrange for the transfer of your data or to discuss the specifics of your data.</p>

<span class="bold">Volume Data Format</span><br>

<p>Volumes should be provided per TMC and can be provided as AADT or broken down by time bins. Broken down by time bins is the preferred method, as it is a significantly more accurate measurement of hourly volume compared to AADT.</p>
<p>The following definitions are used:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="bold">AADT </span>(AADT provided): Annual Average Daily Traffic of the related TMC link.</li>
	<li><span class="bold">Volume </span>(time bins provided): Aggregated volume at 15 minute intervals for each day of week for every year. For instance, the volume of a single TMC for every Tuesday
																at 5:30 PM for the year of 2013 is 684</li>
	<li><span class="bold">Time Bin </span>(time bins provided): Represents the 15 minute interval.

<h2>Providing Your Data for MAP-21</h2>

<p>Our MAP-21 tools offer a means to track progress on the measures proposed in subpart E (National Performance Management Measures for the NHPP System Performance) and subpart F (National Performance Management Measures for Freight Movement on the Interstate) of the final ruling.</p>

<p>They also require two other data sets to provide accurate results:</p>
<ol class="number-list">
  <li><span class="bold">Speed Limits: </span>Agencies must fill NPMRDS gaps in speed readings with posted speed limits.  To provide accurate results, these gaps must be updated each new conflation year.</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Volume Data: </span>By default, we generate a volume data set for MAP-21 measures based on the conflation with HPMS AADT data included in the NPMRDS shapefile. Agencies can choose to provide additional volume sets to override these values if desired.</li>
</ol>

<p>The CATT Lab is working with our data partners to develop national volume data sets from the HPMS; however, we encourage agencies to submit their own volume and speed limit databases to us by sending them to <a href="mailto:intake@ritis.org" target="_blank">intake@ritis.org</a>. We can incorporate your speed limit and/or volume data into our free tools at no charge if you can provide them in the following formats:</p>

<h2>Performance Metrics</h2>

The following metrics are calculated from the raw data. The definitions are from
the <a href="http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tt_reliability/brochure/" target="_blank">Travel Time Reliability publication</a> provided
by the Federal Highway Administration and produced by the Texas Transportation Institute with Cambridge Systematics, Inc.
<blockquote>
  <p>
<b>Comparative Speed</b> — Measured speed as a percentage of the historical average speed for this time of
day and day of week.
</p>

  <p>
<b>Congestion: Free Flow Speed</b> — Measured speed as a percentage of the free flow speed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Congestion: Posted Speed Limit</b> — Measured speed as a percentage of the posted speed limit.
</p>

  <p>
<b>Historical Average Congestion: Free Flow Speed</b> — Historical average speed as a percentage of the free flow speed for
this time of day and day of week.
</p>
<p>
<b>Historical Average Congestion: Posted Speed Limit</b> — Historical average speed as a percentage of the posted speed limit for 
this time of day and day of week.
</p>

  <b>Buffer Time</b> — The extra time (or time cushion) that travelers must add to their average travel time when planning trips to ensure on-time arrival (95% Travel Time - Average Travel Time).
  <p>
  <b>Buffer Index</b> — The Buffer Time's percentage value of the Average Travel Time ((95% Travel Time - Average Travel Time) / Average Travel Time).
  Its value increases as reliability gets worse. For example, a buffer index of .4 (40 percent) means that, for a 20-minute average travel time,
  a traveler should budget an additional 8 minutes (20 minutes x 40 percent = 8 minutes) to ensure on-time arrival most of the time.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Planning Time</b> — The total time a traveler should plan for to ensure on-time arrival (95% Travel Time).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Planning Time Index: Free Flow Speed</b> — The total travel time that should be planned when an adequate buffer time is included (95% Travel Time / Free-flow Travel Time).
  The planning time index differs from the buffer index because it includes typical delay as well as unexpected delay. Thus,
  the planning time index compares near-worst case travel time to a travel time in light or free-flow traffic. For example, a planning time index of 1.60 means that,
  for a 15-minute trip in light traffic, the total time that should be planned for the trip is 24 minutes (15 minutes x 1.60 = 24 minutes).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Planning Time Index: Posted Speed Limit</b> — The total travel time that should be planned when an adequate buffer time is included (95% Travel Time / Speed Limit Travel Time). 
  The planning time index differs from the buffer index in that it includes typical delay as well as unexpected delay. Thus, 
  the planning time index compares near-worst case travel time to a travel time in traffic moving at the posted speed limit. For example, a planning time index of 1.60 means that, 
  for a 15-minute trip when moving at the speed limit, the total time that should be planned for the trip is 24 minutes (15 minutes x 1.60 = 24 minutes).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Travel Time Index: Free Flow Speed</b> — Travel time represented as a percentage of the ideal travel time (Travel Time / Free-flow Travel Time).
  </p>
  <b>Travel Time Index: Posted Speed Limit</b> — Travel time represented as a percentage of the ideal travel time (Travel Time / Speed Limit Travel Time).
  <p>
  </p>

Note: For aggregate values, individual segment readings are weighted by their length.

Your available metrics will depend on which datasources you have access to.

	<h3>Aggregating Metrics Across Multiple Segments</h3>

<p>
Each visualization that displays data that is aggregated over multiple segments
(e.g. Performance Charts) uses a weighted average based on the length of the individual segments.
Any missing measurements are ignored when calculating performance measures.

	<h3>Key Variables for Performance Metrics</h3>

Using the archive of reported speed readings, the average speed, 95th percentile speed,
and total number of readings are aggregated for each road segment. These values are broken
down per month, day of week, and hour of the day. These aggregate values are used to

<h3>Aggregating Speed Data for Each Road Segment TMC</h3>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean" target="_blank">harmonic mean</a> is a type of average
typically used for speeds taken across a given distance. The arithmetic mean is used when taking the average of
speeds over given periods of time. Since probe data provides speeds over certain distances, it is averaged with the harmonic mean.
It is used in each tool to aggregate speed data for each road segment. For Performance Charts, Performance Summaries,
and the Dashboard, the harmonic mean is taken over a set of road segments to get the average speed of a whole road.
<p>
To calculate the harmonic mean of a set of speeds, divide the total distance by the total travel time.
This differs from the arithmetic mean, where the total speed is divided by the number of speeds being averaged.
</p>
<p>
For example, the table below shows some sample 1-minute raw data for a single TMC.
</p>
<p></p>
<table class="center">
	<tbody><tr>
		<th>Miles</th>
		<th>Time Stamp</th>
		<th>Speed</th>
		<th>Travel Time</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>16:00</td>
		<td>60</td>
		<td>1.00</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>16:01</td>
		<td>55</td>
		<td>1.09</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>16:02</td>
		<td>50</td>
		<td>1.20</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>16:03</td>
		<td>45</td>
		<td>1.33</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>16:04</td>
		<td>40</td>
		<td>1.50</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
<img class="center" src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/average-travel-time-example.png" alt="average travel time example">
</p>
<p>
With a constant TMC length, the harmonic mean can be calculated using only the speeds at each
minute by modifying the formula with a constant distance:
</p>
<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/harmonic_mean_equation.png" alt="harmonic mean equation">
</p>
<table class="mean-examples">
	<tbody><tr>
		<th>Harmonic Mean</th>
		<th>Arithmetic Mean</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="content">
			<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/harmonic_mean_example.png" alt="harmonic mean example">
		</td>
		<td class="content">
			<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/arithmetic_mean_example.png" alt="arithemtic mean example">
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
The average travel time for this TMC over the 5 minute span is 1.22 minutes. The harmonic mean
gives an average of 49 mph. Since the length of the TMC is 1 mile, this implies an average travel
time of 1.22 minutes. The arithmetic mean of the speeds gives an average of 50 mph, which implies an average
travel time of 1.20 minutes. Unlike the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean preserves the true average travel time.

<h1>TMC Codes</h1>

The Probe Data Analytics Suite uses the TMC (traffic message channel) standard to uniquely identify each road segment.
Under this standard, each road segment is referred to as a TMC, and TMCs are identified by a unique 9-digit TMC code.
For example, 110+04629 represents the eastbound stretch of I-495 in Maryland between exits 24 and 25.
<p>
TMCs generally span a stretch of road from one exit or entrance ramp to the next.
The fourth character of a TMC code signifies whether it is an "internal" or "external" segment.
Internal segments represent a stretch of road within an interchange (e.g. between an exit ramp and an entrance ramp).
External segments represent a stretch of road between interchanges.
</p>
<p>
The following diagram illustrates the difference between internal and external TMCs.
Note that the first 3 characters of each TMC code are omitted in the diagram.
</p>
<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/tmcs_diagram.png">
</p>
<p>
While there are several situations where this doesn't apply (for example, inner and outer loop road geometry),
the typical convention for identifying the direction of travel for the TMC and whether the path is internal or external is:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>"P": Northbound or Eastbound, internal paths</li>
	<li>"N": Southbound or Westbound, internal paths</li>
	<li>"+": Northbound or Eastbound, external paths</li>
	<li>"-": Southbound or Westbound, external paths</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Maps displaying TMCs differently</h2>

TMC segments, despite being a standard method of locating specific stretches of road,
are not always handled identically between different map data providers.
Due to licensing restrictions, the TMC segment geometries used by our data providers
may not always match those used within the RITIS base map. This occasionally causes
perceived gaps in road coverage or incorrect segment geometries on our maps.
<p>
Notice that this is only a display issue when viewing a visualization using a map view.
The TMC lengths provided by the original source (and included in the download files)
are what is used in our calculations behind the scenes.

	<h1>Bottlenecks</h1>

<p>
At a high-level, bottlenecks are locations on the roadway where conditions have fallen below a certain percent of the reference speed for an extended period of time. The temporal and geospatial extent of bottlenecks can be used to determine which locations are particularly troublesome for the traveling public. This page describes the algorithm used to track and rank bottleneck locations and the metrics we compute for each location.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in learning more about some of the metrics we use to rank bottlenecks, see the <span class="italic">Bottleneck Ranking Table</span> section in <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#bottleneck-ranking">Bottleneck Ranking</a>

	<a name="topic-marker/bottlenecks_algorithm" id="bottlenecks_algorithm"></a>
	
<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<h3>Terminology</h3>
The following terms are used for defining how congestion is tracked and analyzed to
identify bottleneck locations:
<p></p>
<ul class="tight">
	<li><b>Occurrence</b> — Congestion, whose head is at a given point on the road at a single point in time</li>
	<li><b>Element</b> — Congestion, whose head is at a given point on the road, that can change in length over time</li>
	<li><b>Blob</b> — A collection of spatially and temporally adjacent congestion elements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Occurrences</h3>
The foundation of tracking congestion and identifying bottlenecks is based on analyzing
a probe speed data set at each reading interval to identify groups of consecutive
congested road segments, or <span class="bold italic">occurrences</span>. Road segments
are considered congested if the reported speed falls below 60% of the reference (or
free-flow) speed.
<p>
Upon identification, each <span class="italic">occurrence</span> is assigned a set of
attributes derived from the source data, including head location (defined as the furthest
downstream segment), the date and time at which the <span class="italic">occurrence</span>
was observed, the set of road segments included, and an impact value. The impact of an
<span class="italic">occurrence</span> is currently calculated as the total length for all
road segments included in the <span class="italic">occurrence</span>.
</p>

<h3>Elements</h3>
<span class="italic">Occurrences</span> from sequential probe speed data readings that
share identical head locations are combined into <span class="bold italic">elements</span>.
<span class="italic">Occurrences</span> that do not share an identical head location to
any <span class="italic">occurrence</span> from the previous reading interval will become
a new <span class="italic">element</span>. Each sequential reading interval analyzed will
produce its own set of <span class="italic">occurrences</span> that will be used to either
update the attributes of existing <span class="bold italic">elements</span> from the
previous reading or create a <span class="bold italic">element</span>.
<p>
<span class="italic">Elements</span> are assigned a set of attributes derived from the
<span class="italic">occurrences</span> they are comprised of, including a head location,
a start date and time (derived from the earliest <span class="italic">occurrence</span>),
the unioned set of road segments included in all <span class="italic">occurrences</span>,
and an impact value equal to the sum of the individual
<span class="italic">occurrence</span> impact values. <span class="italic">Elements</span>
are also assigned an end date and time when there are no longer any
<span class="italic">occurrences</span> identified with a matching head location to an
active <span class="italic">element</span>.
</p>
<p>
The final state of an <span class="italic">element's</span> attributes provides a good
indication of the total effect congestion at the <span class="italic">element's</span>
location had on the roadway. Because of this, <span class="italic">elements</span> serve
as the primary building block from which bottleneck locations are identified and ranked.
</p>

<h3>Blobs</h3>
While <span class="italic">elements</span> do a great job of focusing on specific locations
on a roadway, there are benefits to identifying the relationships between different
congested locations. These relationships may be useful in identifying larger stretches of
road with multiple bottleneck locations that regularly impact each other or in filtering
out short-lived congestion that is either insignificant or caused by a momentary lapse in
data quality. To enable these benefits, <span class="italic">elements</span> that are
spatially and temporally adjacent to each other are grouped together into a
<span class="bold italic">blob</span>.
<p>
Similar to how <span class="italic">elements</span> are built from a collection of
<span class="italic">occurrences</span>, <span class="italic">blobs</span> are built from
a collection of <span class="italic">elements</span>. The main difference is that while all
<span class="italic">occurrences</span> that make up an <span class="italic">element</span>
must share an identical head location, a <span class="italic">blob</span> includes all
<span class="italic">elements</span> that move into, merge into, or diverge from each other.
</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">Blobs</span> are assigned attributes that are derived from the
<span class="italic">elements</span> they are comprised of, including a head location (the
furthest downstream head location from all <span class="italic">elements</span>), a tail
location (the furthest upstream head location from all <span class="italic">elements</span>),
a start date and time (the earliest start time of all <span class="italic">elements</span>),
and end date and time (the latest end time of all <span class="italic">elements</span>),
the unioned set of road segments included in all <span class="italic">elements</span>, and an
impact value equal to the sum of the individual <span class="italic">element</span> impact
values.
</p>

<h2>Sample Scenarios</h2>

The following sample scenarios will help visualize how congestion is tracked and
<span class="italic">occurrences</span>, <span class="italic">elements</span>, and
<span class="italic">blobs</span> are identified. The conditions presented in the scenarios
are relatively simple, but the general progression of congestion in each represents common
congestion conditions seen in the actual probe speed data sets. Conditions covered include:
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span class="bold">Growing and Shrinking</span> - congestion occurs at a single location and may grow and shrink over time
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="bold">Moving Upstream</span> - congestion forms at one location and then moves upstream
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="bold">Merging and Diverging</span> - congestion at two locations merge and then split
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="bold">Mutliple Locations</span> - congestion occurs at multiple locations and times
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Energy Use and Emissions Tools</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Several of the tools within the Probe Data Analytics Suite allow for analysis of energy and emissions data, which is
calculated based on motor vehicles' travel modes. Within these tool, two energy use models are available, along with a
single emissions model. The energy use models include the
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/route-energy-prediction-model.html">Route Energy Prediction Model (Route-E)</a>
developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The second model is a Bayesian Model developed by the
Maryland Transportation Institute (MTI) that was derived from the Environmental Protection Agency's Motor Vehicle Emission
Simulator (MOVES) model. The MTI Bayesian model is also capable of estimating CO<sub>2</sub>, NOX, PM, VOC, and PM2.5-NOX
precursor emissions.
</p>
<h3>Energy Use and Emissions Tools available in Probe Data Analytics</h3>
<p></p>
<ol><li>
<b>Energy Use and Emissions Table Widget</b> – Provides real-time estimates of energy use and emissions on your selected
road segments. Historical and predictive estimates are also available for reference points.
</li><li>
<b>Energy Use and Emissions Matrix</b> - Provides the aggregated hour-by-hour breakdown of sustainability metrics for your
defined analysis period.
</li><li>
<b>Energy Use and Emissions Trend Map</b> – Provides a map based hourly animation of sustainability metrics for your
defined road segments and time ranges.
</li><li>
<b>Energy Use and Emissions Charts</b> – Provides a breakdown of sustainability metrics by engine type, vehicle class, hour
of day, day of week, and month of year.
</li><li>
<b>Vehicle Ownership Charts</b> – Provides trend analysis of engine types registered in specific zip codes.
</li></ol>
<p>
You can navigate to each of these tools in the Probe Data Analytics Suite landing page. For additional support on road
selection in the query forms follow the support link provided <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#selecting-roads">here.</a>
</p>
<h3>Methodology Summary</h3>
<p>
The methodologies for these tools were developed to utilize existing transportation sector data sources to support real-time,
predictive, and historical analysis. The general framework of the tools is presented in the figure below.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/ee-framework.png" alt="ee-framework" class="ee-framework">
<figcaption>Energy Use and Emissions Framework</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As shown in the help contents for each tool, you can select between the Route-E and MTI-Bayesian models for energy use
estimation. It is worth noting that only the MTI-Bayesian model is capable of predictive analytics. 
</p>
<h3>Route-E Model</h3>
<p>
The Route Energy Prediction Model (Route-E) is a software package that enables accurate estimation of energy consumption for a
variety of vehicle types over trips or sub-trips where detailed drive cycle data are unavailable. Applications include vehicle
route selection, energy accounting and optimization in transportation simulation, and corridor energy analyses, among others.
A summary of the Route-E energy use model is provided in the figure below. More details on the Route-E model can be found
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/route-energy-prediction-model.html">here</a>.

<figcaption>RouteE Model Framework</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>MTI-Bayesian Model</h3>
<p>
The MTI-Bayesian model is based on the EPA MOVES model but with relaxed inputs and assumptions to enable more computationally
efficient estimates of link level energy use and emissions. The model was calibrated and validated using real-world energy
consumption results from on-board diagnostic recording devices for ~2,500 trips in the greater Washington, D.C. region. A
summary of the MTI-Bayesian energy use and emissions model is provided in the figure below.

<h1>Selecting Roads</h1>

Many of the tools share common components for selecting the roads to use in the report or export. The road selector allows you to choose individual roads, regions, or a list of raw TMC codes to analyze.
<blockquote>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/roadselector.png" alt="road selector screenshot">
</blockquote>
The <b>Road</b> tab lets you search roads by name. If you have access to more than one data source, a dropdown menu will be available to let you select which data source you want to search in. To narrow down the search, another dropdown menu lets you restrict the search to a specific state.
<p>
Once you select a road, a new panel will appear below with further options, and the road will be drawn on the map. You can refine the road by toggling on and off individual directions or choose to narrow the road down from either end.
</p>
<p>
If you are done editing and wish to hide the controls, you can close the editing window by clicking the minimize button (the solid triangle in the upper-left corner), and if you need to edit it further, just click again to re-open the editor. You do not need to close the editing window in order for your changes to be applied. All changes you make in this editor will be shown on the preview map.
</p>
<p>
Multiple roads can be added to your selection, and you can remove them by clicking the X button.
</p>
<p>
Selections can also be hidden from the map by clicking the eye button. This affects only the drawing on the map; it does not change your selection.
</p>
<p>
The <b>advanced</b> option allows you to supply more than just the state filter for your initial road search. You can filter down on individual counties, road directions, zip codes, or particular road classes.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Region</b> tab will select all TMCs with a state, county, or zip code. You can also filter by direction and road class.
</p>
<p>
The <b>List of TMC Codes</b> tab lets you enter a list of TMC codes.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Map</b> tab lets you select and exclude TMCs by drawing shapes directly on the map. You can draw, edit and delete any combination of rectangles, circles and complex polygons. You can filter the TMCs in your selection by state and road class using the dropdowns. When you have made your selection the TMCs within your shapes will be added as a list of raw TMC codes.
</p>
<p>
No matter how you make your selection, you can use the “Save as TMC set” button to make it easier to use the same selection later on for different queries, or even in different tools.

<h2>Functional Road Classes</h2>
<p>
Functional Road Classes, or FRC's, are the class or group of roads to which the road belongs. The available list of FRC's varies depending on the segment type that is being selected.

<p>
  Functional Class = 1 roads allow for high volume, maximum speed traffic movement between and through major metropolitan areas.
  <br>
  Functional Class = 1 is applied to roads with very few, if any, speed changes. Access to the road is usually controlled.
</p>
<p>
  Functional Class = 2 roads are used to channel traffic to Functional Class = 1 roads for travel between and through cities in the shortest amount of time.
  <br>
  Functional Class = 2 is applied to roads with very few, if any speed changes that allow for high volume, high speed traffic movement.
</p>
<p>
  Functional Class = 3 is applied to roads which interconnect Functional Class = 2 roads and provide a high volume of traffic movement at a lower level of mobility than Functional Class = 2 roads.
</p>
<p>
  Functional Class = 4 is applied to roads that provide for a high volume of traffic movement at moderate speeds between neighbourhoods. These roads connect with higher functional class roads to collect and distribute traffic between neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>
  Functional Class = 5 is applied to roads whose volume and traffic movement are below the level of any functional class. In addition, walkways, truck only roads, bus only roads, and emergency vehicle only roads receive Functional Class = 5.

<h1>Region Explorer</h1>

The Region Explorer shows the relationships between <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#bottlenecks">bottlenecks</a> and <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#icon-legend">traffic events</a>
and their impacts on traffic conditions in real-time or at previous points in the past. The bottlenecks and events are shown both in a
table and on a map. 

For a demonstration, see the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/tutorials?video=regionexplorer">Region Explorer tutorial</a>.

	<a name="topic-marker/region-explorer_filters" id="region-explorer_filters"></a>
	<h2>Filters</h2>

You can specify filters to narrow down the list of bottlenecks and events.
Only the items that match all of the filter criteria will be shown in the list and map.
After entering a filter term, you can choose which field to apply the filter to.
If you specify multiple filter terms for the same field, bottlenecks and events that
match any of the terms will be included in the results.
<p>
For example, entering "395" and "295" as location filters and "North" as a direction
filter will remove all bottlenecks and events not on the northbound side of a road named either "395" or "295".
</p>

</p>
<p>
You can choose to look at real-time data or data from a previous point in
time by using the "Time selection" button in the bottom left corner of the map.
</p>
<p>
When looking at real-time data, new bottlenecks and events will appear in the
dashboard automatically as they occur on the road, and they will be updated as conditions on the road change.
</p>
<p>
When using the point-in-time mode, all bottlenecks and events that existed at the selected time are shown.
Bottlenecks are shown at the maximum length they reached.

<h2>Displaying Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/region_explorer_bottleneck_table.png">
</p>
<p>
In the table, the shading behind the description of each bottleneck represents the
physical length of the bottleneck on the road and how long the bottleneck has been in place.
</p>
<p>
The width of the shaded area represents the length of the bottleneck.
A shaded area filling the cell denotes a bottleneck that is 10 miles long or longer.
A 7.5 mile bottleneck would fill 75% of the cell, a 5 mile bottleneck would fill 50% of the cell, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The color of the shaded area denotes the age of the bottleneck.
<span class="red">Red</span> represents bottlenecks older than 2 hours, <span class="yellow">yellow</span> is used for bottlenecks that have
been in place for 45 minutes, and <span class="green">green</span> is used for bottlenecks that are less than 15 minutes old.

	<h1>Massive Data Downloader</h1>

<p>
The Massive Data Downloader allows you to export probe data as a CSV for offline analysis.
</p>

	
		


	
	
	<a name="topic-marker/massive-data-downloader_requests" id="massive-data-downloader_requests"></a>
	

<h2>Submitting export requests</h2>

You can customize your reports by choosing which roads to include, which dates and time periods to include, and how to aggregate the data.

  <p>
  You can see a video demonstration in the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/tutorials?video=mdd">Massive Data Downloader tutorial</a>.
  </p>

<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/massive_screenshot.png" alt="MDD screenshot">
</p>
<p>
The first step lets you select which roads to include in your download.
Your road selection will be displayed on the map as you add roads, regions, or TMCs.
See <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#selecting-roads">Selecting roads</a> for detailed instructions.
</p>
<p>
The next three components let you customize the time periods.
Start by selecting date ranges. You can include multiple date ranges.
These ranges can be filtered to include only certain days of the week or times of day.
</p>
<p>
The “data sources and measures” section has nested checkboxes;
the top level is a list of data sources that your account has access to.
When you select a data source, you will see a list of checkboxes for each of the available data fields.
See the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#data-types">Data Types</a> page for a description of those fields.
</p>
<p>
The "Null record handling" checkbox lets you exclude records with no data. This can help decrease the size of the export.
</p>

<h3>Averaging</h3>

In exported data sets that use averaging, the times reported with each reading will represent the beginning of the time window that was averaged.
For example, with 15 minute averaging, the reported speed for 3:00 PM will be the average of each speed reading taken between 3:00:00 and 3:14:59 PM.

<h3>Submitting your export request</h3>

Before submitting, you can give your export a custom title.
This will be used in the email and in My History to identify your export, and it will be the default name for the zip file when you download it.
If left blank, a default description will be created based on the parameters of your export. For example, "All fields for I-295 on Jan 30, 2015".
<p>
A checkbox allows you to opt out of the notification email.
</p>
<p>
You can check the status of your export using the "My History" link in the top right of the page.

The size of your export file depends on the complexity of the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#massive-data-downloader/requests">export you submitted</a>.
Each row will show a TMC and a timestamp. Consider an export for I-95, which goes from Florida to Maine.
Let's look at an export for a single day (Feb 1, 2017, in this case).
NPMRDS has 3,018 TMCs along 3,643 miles of roadway. If you select 1-hour averaging,
your export will have 24 rows for each of 3,018 TMCs. That's 72,432 rows (636 KB).
If you request 5-minute averaging, you'll get 12 times as much data: 869,184 rows (5,303KB).
You can try to reduce the filesize by unchecking the Null record handling option.
</p>
<p>
When viewed in a spreadsheet program (such as Excel), the data will look like this:

<h2>FAQ's</h2>


<h3>Why does my TMC_Identification.csv from the Massive Data Downloader not include all the segments I included in my export request?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>You might see this happen if your export request was for a time period prior to the current version of the vendor's metadata.
    When you search for segments, the search is done against the current version of the vendor's metadata. When the TMC_Identification
    file is built, it uses the version of the metadata that was active during the time period of your export request. The consequence
    of this is that newer segments will not be included in your export for the simple reason that they did not exist during the time
    period of your request. For example, if you queried for 50 segments but 10 of them were introduced in the newest version of the
    metadata and your time period only included dates from the previous version, your TMC_Identification file will only include info
    on 40 segments.</p>



<h3>What version of the INRIX metadata is used to populate the inventory file included in Massive Data Downloader export requests?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Due to the more fluid nature of XD metadata, Massive Data Downloader uses the most up-to-date version of the
    XD metadata from INRIX to populate the identification file for XD exports.</p>

After clicking "submit", a new tab or window will open for each data source (depending on your browser’s settings). You can always revisit these reports through My History.
</p>
<p>
You can also enter Congestion Scan from the reports created by Trend Map and Performance Charts, using the "Open with…" button.
These tools can link to Congestion Scan only if the TMC selection used to generate their visualizations used simple or
advanced road search or unmerged TMC sets created using simple or advanced road search.
For example, Trend Maps created with region search will not be able to be opened in Congestion Scan.
</p>
<h2>Saved segment set restrictions</h2>
<p>
  Because Congestion Scan is useful only if the road selections that make it up are well-ordered, only segment sets that
  have an underlying order are available in Congestion Scan, specifically unmerged sets created using the "Road" tab.
  Region search, raw segment code entry, and map search are unavailable in Congestion Scan (as is the loading of segment sets
  created using these features).

<h1>Corridor Speed Bins</h1>
<p>Corridor Speed Bins counts the number of probe readings recorded for various congestion measures and displays time aggregated bins to explore patterns on a stretch of road. This tool uses the same road diagram found in Congestion Scan and Corridor Time Comparison to identify road segments that have a higher frequency of delay. You can select up to seven unique time periods to compare, and you can filter those down to a specific time of day.</p>

<h2>Corridor Speed Bins Query Form</h2>

<p>
  Corridor Speed Bins' query form uses many of the same controls found in other query forms across the suite with a few minor restrictions in place due to the nature of the resulting visualization:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Corridor Speed Bins' resulting visualization presents all selected segments aligned to a single road diagram. If you select multiple roads using a data source that is based on the TMC standard they will appear stitched together one after the other in the results. For XD segments, on the other hand, the first south or west bearing road will appear on the left side of the resulting visualization, and the first north or east bearing road will appear on the right.</li>
  <li>You can select up to seven time periods.</li>
  <li>You can select one time of day range, the default being midnight to midnight.</li>
</ul>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/query-form.png" class="fitwidth" alt="Corridor Time Comparison query form">

<p>The options available in Corridor Speed Bins' query form are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a country - You will only see this option if you have access to data from multiple countries.</li>
  <li>Select roads - See <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#selecting-roads">Selecting Roads</a> for more information on this step. Like Congestion Scan and Corridor Time Comparison, Corridor Speed Bins has a limited number of options available for road selection because the resulting visualization only works with selections of contiguous segments.</li>
  <li>Select time periods - For this step you can make up to seven selections. A time period is a range of days that can optionally be filtered by day of week.</li>
  <li>Select a time range - A time range covers a particular range of minutes throughout a day (e.g. 4:30 AM to 9:45 AM). The default is midnight to midnight</li>
  <li>Select data source - Due to differences between base map data across different data providers, it is best to choose the same data source here that you selected when choosing which provider to search for roads from. If you do not do this your results might be missing data for some segments.</li>
  <li>Provide a title - The title you choose here will be displayed on the results page and in My History, helping you identify this report later. If you do not choose a title here you can do so on the results page or in My History.</li>
  <li>Notes - This allows you to enter additional free text about your report. As with the title, you can edit the notes from the results page and My History.</li>

<h2>Corridor Speed Bins Results</h2>

<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/corridor-speed-bins-overview.png" class="fitwidth">

<p>
  Corridor Speed Bins' result visualization counts every probe reading received during the time periods and times of day you selected and displays charts reflecting how many of those readings' values fall within configurable ranges (or "bins").
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you have a time period of January 1, 2023 - January 7, 2023 and a time range of 8 AM - 9 AM, there are 420 minutes of readings to consider (7 days x 60 minutes each). If you configured the result page's color threshold slider to color speeds below 10 mph purple and there were 42 readings below 10 mph for a particular segment, 10% of the bar that represents that segment would be colored purple.
</p>
<p>
  Hovering the mouse over any bin will display details about the readings included within it. Clicking will lock the tooltip in place. In this example we have selected two time periods, November 23 and November 24 of 2022, and are looking at the full day for each (midnight to midnight). We've moused over a particular bin on November 23rd's MD-97/Georgia Ave/Exit 31 entry. We can see that of the 24 hours of readings that make up that time period 6 hours and 19 minutes of them, or 26.32%, had speeds between 50 and 59 mph.
</p>

<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/tooltip.png" class="fitwidth">

<div>
  <p>
    The "Data type" dropdown lets you select one of three different metrics for display in your charts: speed, congestion, and comparative speed.

    The "Color Thresholds" slider lets you choose how the selected metric's possible values should be colored. You can adjust the range of values by grabbing any of the slider's handles and dragging them to the desired position, and you can click on any point on the slider track to open a color picker to adjust the color for that particular range of values. The circular arrow button next to the "Color Thresholds" label allows you to reset the slider's values to their defaults.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example we've set the color for speeds from 0 to 10 mph to black and speeds above 50 mph to teal.

    <li>Graph display mode - These options allow you to choose whether or not you want to see the borders between different segments on the graphs.</li>
    <li>Arrange time periods - Using these buttons you can control in which order the time periods' charts appear. The default places the first time period you selected on the outside and each one after that closer and closer to the road diagram. Note that this option is only available if you selected more than one time period.</li>
    <li>Show - These options allow you to turn on and off the graphs on the left and right side of the road diagram.</li>
    <li>Color Bins - These controls supplement the color threshold slider, allowing you turn off the visibility of entire bins of color.</li>
    <li>Show time periods - This option allows you to hide charts of certain time periods. This can be helpful if you've selected several and want to look at them one at a time. Note that this option is only available if you selected more than one time period.</li>
    <li>Zooming - These options allow you to choose if you want to enable advanced zooming or mouse wheel zooming. When advanced zooming is enabled, slider handles will appear on the road diagram that you can drag up or down to narrow down the view to specific sections of your road selection.</li>
    <li>Clear all tooltips - This button will remove all tooltips that you've locked in place by clicking on the charts.</li>

<h1>Corridor Time Comparison</h1>

Corridor Time Comparison offers a unique way to visualize congestion along a particular roadway corridor.
Essentially a hybrid of <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#performance-charts">Performance Charts</a> and <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#congestion-scan">Congestion Scan</a>, Corridor Time Comparison displays bi-directional line charts associated with segments on a corridor averaged over a particular date range and time of day.
You can select one or two date ranges and up to seven times of day for analysis.
In total, Corridor Time Comparison can display a maximum of 14 unique date ranges + times of day combinations in each direction of travel.
The results include the choice of five different metrics that can be displayed: speed, congestion, travel time index, buffer index, and planning time index.

<h2>Corridor Time Comparison Results</h2>
<p>Corridor Time Comparison's result visualization will average all probe data received for each selected segment during each pairing of the time periods and the times of days you selected. For example, if your selected time periods were May 2023 and May 13th, 2023 and your selected time ranges were 4:30 AM to 9:45 AM and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM the resulting chart would have data series for each segment for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All days from May 2023, 4:30 AM - 9:45 AM</li>
  <li>All days from May 2023, 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM</li>

	<h2>Historical Average Speed Illustrative Example</h2>

<p>
  Historical average speed is the average speed, in miles per hour, observed for a particular roadway segment periodically calculated for that hour of the day and day of week.
  Each segment has 168 distinct historical average speed values (24 x 7 = 168), covering each of 24 hours across the 7 days of week that repeat on a weekly basis.
  Historical average speed values are periodically updated based on prior probe data.
  Corridor Time Comparison calculates a single average speed for each segment using the harmonic mean of all days of the week and hours of the day included in a query.
  Representative examples of historical average speed calculations are illustrated below:
</p>
<b>Period Selected:</b> Thursday March 24,2022 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM:
<p>
  The historical average speed would represent the harmonic mean of the 3 hourly data points for Thursdays.
</p>
<b>Period Selected:</b> Tuesday March 22,2022 - Thursday March 24, 2022 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM:
<p>
  The historical average speed would represent the harmonic mean of the 9 hourly data points including 3 from Tuesdays, 3 from Wednesdays and 3 from Thursdays.
</p>
<b>Period Selected:</b> Tuesday March 1, 2022 - Thursday March 31, 2022 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM:
<p>
  The historical average speed would represent the harmonic mean of the 93 hourly data points including 12 from Mondays, 15 from Tuesdays, 15 from Wednesdays, 15 from Thursdays, 12 from Fridays, 12 from Saturdays and 12 from Sundays.
  Although there are 93 hourly data points, only 15 of them, 3 per day of week, are unique in terms of their historical average speed values.
  As there are 5 Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in March 2022, with only 4 of each of the remaining days of the week, those 3 days are weighted more heavily.

<h1>Performance Charts</h1>

<p>
Performance Charts are bar, line, plot, and candlestick charts representing aggregate conditions across stretches of road.
The charts can be grouped by time period or by road direction. TMCs that share the same direction,
regardless of which road they appear on, will be combined into the charts that are based on road direction.
</p>
<p>
Your data can include multiple directions and date ranges. Use the "Mode" dropdown to display a chart of each direction,
or a chart for each period. The other mode will then be drawn as overlapping data. For example, a chart for all westbound
traffic could have overlapping display for multiple months (each shown with a different color).
</p>
<p>
The vertical axis of each chart represents the performance metric being compared,
while the horizontal axis splits the data by the granularity selected.
</p>
<p>
You can switch between different chart types and layouts, choose which metric is plotted on the vertical axis,
and toggle the visibility of each series.
</p>
<p>
If you are viewing a line chart, the dark inner band represents the 25th and 75th percentiles for your time range.
Likewise the light outer band shows the 5th and 95th percentiles.
</p>
<p>
The candlestick chart displays the 25th and 75th percentiles as a vertical bar while the 5th and 95th percentiles
are represented by the lines above and below the bar.
</p>
<p>
As you mouse over the chart you will see data tips for the values under your mouse cursor,
and you can click the chart to lock those data tips in place. This can be handy if you'd like to take a screenshot
using the "Save as" button in the upper right.
</p>
<p>
The charts can also be exported to Excel, or opened with the other tools.
</p>
<p>
The Metric drop-down controls which data field is displayed in the charts.

<h1>Performance Summaries</h1>

<p>
Performance Summaries allow you to create reports on performance metrics grouped by day of week, weekdays, and weekends across a stretch of road.
</p>
<p>
Begin by selecting the roads and date ranges you're interested in analyzing.
See the documentation on <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#selecting-roads">selecting roads</a> for information on how to do this.
</p>
<p>
You can also select one or more data sources and a range to analyze within each time period.
</p>
<p>
Finally you may choose one or more times of the day to analyze within each time period and click submit.
</p>
<p>
Once the results are ready, you will be able to toggle between the time periods and directions of the roads you
selected with the tabs located near the top.
</p>
<p>
Each tab contains a number of performance metrics, such as buffer time, buffer index and so on.
For more information on the metrics used in this application visit our <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#data-types">Data Types</a> help page.
</p>
<p>
The summary data can be exported to Excel, or saved as a screenshot using the "Save as" button in the upper right.
Also, if you'd like to view the data in another tool in the Probe Data Analytics Suite, choose "Switch to..." and select the tool.

Bottleneck Ranking allows you to identify, rank, and explore bottleneck locations on the roadway.
<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/bottleneck_ranking_overview.png" class="fitwidth">
</p>

<h3>Bottleneck Ranking Table</h3>

<h4>New Metrics</h4>
We have added three new metrics to the bottleneck ranking table to provide users with additional insight to bottlenecks impacting your roadway system. These metrics allow users to weight the traditional impact metric (now referred to as the base impact) by other relevant factors, including:
<p></p>
<ul class="tight">
  <li>Magnitude of Speed Drops</li>
  <li>Severity of Congestion</li>
  <li>Estimated Total Delay</li>
</ul>

<p>
By default, the table is sorted by the base impact weighted by the <b>total delay</b>.  Users can re-sort the bottleneck list 
based on the descending values of the weighted metrics simply by clicking on the column title of interest.
</p>

<p>
In addition, we've added direct access to the associated <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#performance-summaries">Performance Summaries</a> and <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#udc-analysis">User Delay Cost</a> for each bottleneck - simply 
click on the icons at the end of the table to gain additional intel on bottleneck impact and cost.  
</p>

<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/bottleneck_ranking_table.png" class="fitwidth">

	<h3>Defining Where Delay Should be Calculated</h3>

You can define the delay threshold based on the following options:
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Historical average speed — Delay is calculated for all segments whose raw speeds fall below the historical
		average speed for that segment. The historical average speed is specific to the time of day and day of week for each
		segment, and is calculated from the previous 2-years of historical speed data. This measure will show delay that is
		"worse than normal." You are also able to enter an "offset" into this equation. For example, if you enter
		"Historical average speed minus 10 mph" then the result will be a delay cost for any time when speeds are 10 mph worse
		than normal congestion for each segment in the set.
	</li>
	<li>
		Free-flow speed — Delay is calculated for all segments whose raw speeds fall below the free-flow speed
		for that segment. Free-flow is the mean speed in mph (capped at 65 mph), and is calculated based upon the
		85th-percentile point of the observed speeds on that segment for all time periods. This measure will show
		delay that is "worse than free-flow." You are also able to enter an "offset" into this equation.
		For example, if you enter "Free-flow speed minus 10 mph" then the result will be a delay cost for any time
		when speeds are 10 mph worse than free-flow.
	</li>
	<li>
		Posted speed limit (PSL) — Delay is calculated for all segments whose raw speeds fall below the posted speed limit
		for that segment. This measure will show delay that is "worse than the speed limit." You are also able to enter an
		"offset" into this equation. For example, if you enter "Posted speed limit minus 10 mph" then the result will be a
		delay cost for any time when speed are 10 mph worse than the speed limit.
	</li>
	<li>
		Absolute speed — Delay is calculated for all segments whose speeds fall below the value you specified.
	</li>
	<li>
		For all segments — Do not exclude any TMC segments.
	</li>
</ul>

	


	
		


	
	
	<a name="topic-marker/udc-analysis_report-parameters_calculate-delay-against" id="udc-analysis_report-parameters_calculate-delay-against"></a>
	<h3>Define What to Calculate Delay Against</h3>

<p>
A major component in calculating delay is what the raw speeds are compared against to determine if delay is present
on the TMC during the analysis period. This can be either the free-flow speed, posted speed limit (PSL), or average speed.
Using the free-flow speed will show delays compared to expected driving conditions. Using the posted speed limit will show
delays compared to driving at the posted speed limit. Using the average speed will show delays compared to typical 
congestion patterns.

	<h2>How User Delay Cost is Calculated</h2>

<p>
User delay calculations are performed hourly at the TMC level, then aggregated
across the requested geographic region for each day in the analysis period.
</p>

<h3>Calculating User Delay Cost with AADT Counts</h3>

When calculating Average Daily Traffic counts (ADT) from Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) counts,
daily factors must be applied.
<p></p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Day of Week</th><th>Adjustment factor</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday to Thursday</td><td>+5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Friday</td><td>+10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Saturday</td><td>-10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sunday</td><td>-20%</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Some TMC segments may span across two or more defined volume link locations,
and vice versa (as shown in Figure 1). In order to obtain a single AADT measurement
for TMCs that fall under this case, the AADT of the overlapped detector locations
must be weighted by the distance of the portion of the TMC that falls into the range of each link location.
</p>
<p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/aadt_links.png" alt="AADT and TMC links">
</p>
<p>
In order to be able to calculate many of the delay analysis measures, hourly profiles
must be found for each TMC to give an hourly volume. In order to find these, the following
calculations must be performed (assuming the necessary data is provided):
</p>
<p>
Functional class of the TMC — the functional class (Freeway or Non-Freeway)
is defined based on TMC information. If the road class is Interstate, the functional class is Freeway.
Any other road class is Non-Freeway.
</p>
<p>
Day type — weekday or weekend, the day of week determines which hourly profile to use.
Note that all hourly weekend delay calculations rely solely on the two unique weekend profiles,
regardless of congestion level or directionality (see Exhibit A-5).
</p>
<p>
Congestion level — can be one of: Low, Moderate, or Severe.
Congestion level is found for each TMC segment through multiple steps:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="udc-congestion-level-steps">
  <li>Calculate an average peak period speed using speed data from 6am - 10am and 3pm - 7pm. The days to select this data from depend on the desired outcome of the reports. If looking at a whole year and you only want to see annual values, each TMC will need to have the average speed calculated for all weekdays (giving one result). If looking at a week of data and you want to see values for every day of the week, the average speed would be calculated per weekday (giving 5 results), therefore five hourly profiles for each day of week.</li>
  <li>Get the free-flow speed* for each TMC.</li>
  <li>Calculate a peak period speed reduction factor that will determine the congestion level. This is done by dividing the average peak period speed by the free-flow speed.*
    <p class="equation">
    speed reduction factor (SRF) = (average peak period speed ÷ free-flow speed*) × 100
    </p>
    <p>
      * If "Define where delay should be calculated" is set to "Posted speed limit," posted speed limit will be used instead of free-flow speed.
    </p>
    <p>
    For Freeways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SRF is greater than or equal to 90 (low congestion)</li>
      <li>SRF is between 75 and 90 (moderate congestion)</li>
      <li>SRF is below 75 (severe congestion)</li>
    </ul>
    For Non-Freeways:
    <ul>
      <li>SRF is greater than or equal to 80 (low congestion)</li>
      <li>SRF is between 65 and 80 (moderate congestion)</li>
      <li>SRF is below 65 (severe congestion)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Determine the directionality of the TMC — Directionality defines which peak period
(AM or PM) this TMC segment is congested worse during. This is found by calculating both peak
period speeds (AM being 6am - 10am and PM being 3pm - 7pm). The lowest speed of the two determines
the directionality. If the difference between the two speeds is less than or equal to 6, the
directionality is considered Even. The same day selection rules for average peak period speed apply here.
</p>
<p>
Assign the hourly profile to the TMC — See the
<a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#udc-analysis/how-user-delay-cost-is-calculated/hourly-distribution-charts">hourly volume distribution charts</a> for percentages
of the ADT for the day. For single days, the ADT for that day must be multiplied for each of the hourly
factors in the profile
</p>

	<h3>Limiting Volumes based on Speeds</h3>

AADT values may over or under estimate how much volume is actually on the road.
As speeds fall on a TMC segment, the amount of vehicles allowed on that segment
must be modified based on the TMC length and number of lanes.
<p>
Volume limitation is only performed on segments with speeds less than 50mph
and reference speeds equal to or greater than 50mph.
</p>
<p>
Calculate the flow volume limit (Eq. B-1):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	flow = 200 × speed ÷ (1 + speed ÷ 15)
</blockquote>
Calculate the maximum jam density (Eq. B-2):
<blockquote class="equation">
	density = 200 ÷ (1 + speed ÷ 15)
</blockquote>
Calculate the proportion of vehicles which occupied the segment at the beginning of the analysis period,
but failed to traverse its entire length at the end of the analysis period (Eq. B-3):
<blockquote class="equation">
	proportion of vehicles failed to traverse = max(0, 1 - [speed × analysis period ÷ tmc length])
</blockquote>
Calculate the number of vehicles that traverse the segment during the analysis period.
If the number of lanes is not present in the data feed, a default value of 2 will be used (Eq. B-4):
<blockquote class="equation">
	vehicles traversed = flow (Eq. B-1) × analysis period × number of lanes
</blockquote>
Calculate the number of vehicles that occupy the segment but fail to traverse (Eq. B-5):
<blockquote class="equation">
	vehicles failed to traverse = density (Eq. B-2) × tmc length × proportion of vehicles failed to traverse (Eq. B-3)
</blockquote>
Jam density may be augmented if the TMC segment is extremely long, and the volumes provided under
estimate the total number of vehicles impacted on the segment. The provided volume needs to be modified
to include any vehicles on the segment that do not traverse within the analysis period, giving a new density.
If speed is 0, the augmented density will be the calculated density from Eq. B-2 (Eq. B-6):
<blockquote class="equation">
	augmented density = volume ÷ speed
</blockquote>
<p>
Calculate the number of vehicles failed to traverse, based on the augmented jam density (Eq. B-7):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	vehicles failed to traverse (augmented) = augmented density (Eq. B-6) × tmc length × proportion of vehicles failed to traverse (Eq. B-3)
</blockquote>
<p>
Calculate the limited volume, correcting for under estimation of delay on long segments, Eq. B-6,
as well as over estimation on short segments during slow speeds, Eq. B-4 and Eq. B-5 (Eq. B-8):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	limited volume = min(volume + vehicles failed to traverse (augmented) (Eq. B-7), vehicles traversed (Eq. B-4) + vehicles failed to traverse (Eq. B-5))
</blockquote>

	<h3>Applying Vehicle Percentages</h3>

With the daily factors calculated, the percentage of passenger and commercial
vehicles must be applied to the volumes, resulting in two new volume metrics: passenger
volume and commercial volume. This is required to calculate an overall total delay cost,
as the value of person time is split by passenger and commercial vehicles.
<p>
Passenger volume (Eq. A-1):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	passenger volume = limited volume (Eq. B-8) × (100 - commercial percent of vehicles / 100)
</blockquote>
Commercial volume (Eq. A-2):
<blockquote class="equation">
	commercial volume = limited volume (Eq. B-8) × (commercial percent of vehicles / 100)
</blockquote>

	<h3>Vehicle-miles of travel</h3>

A key component in calculating the delay of a segment, the vehicle-miles of travel (VMT) of
a segment is found by multiplying the hourly volume of the segment by the length of the segment.
<p>
Vehicle Miles of Travel (VMT) (Eq. A-3):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	VMT = passenger or commercial volume (Eq. A-1 or Eq. A-2) × tmc length

Travel delay is the amount of extra time spent traveling due to congestion.
Travel delay is a representation of the total vehicle hours of delay.
The delay calculations are performed at the individual TMC segment level,
for each hour of day. Travel delay is best calculated at the hourly level,
then aggregated into various summaries, such as weekday peak period,
weekday off-peak period, weekend, daily, etc.
Note that travel delay values cannot be lower than 0.
<p>
There are two kinds of travel delay: vehicle-hours of delay and person-hours of delay.
Vehicle-hours of delay is the total amount of time all vehicles on the chosen segments were delayed.
Person-hours of delay is the total amount of time all passengers on the chosen segments were delayed.
Because passenger cars can have more than one person in them, a 1.25 vehicle occupancy
constant is applied to the passenger vehicle volume to get a more accurate estimation of
</p>
the total person-hours of delay.
<p>
Vehicle-hours of delay (Eq. A-4):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	vehicle-hours of delay = (VMT (Eq. A-3) ÷ speed) -  (VMT (Eq. A-3) ÷ free-flow speed*)
</blockquote>
Person-hours of delay (Eq. A-5):
<blockquote class="equation">
	person-hours of delay = (VMT (Eq. A-3) ÷ speed) -  (VMT (Eq. A-3) ÷ free-flow speed*) × vehicle occupancy
</blockquote>
<p>
* If "Define where delay should be calculated" is set to "Posted speed limit," posted speed limit will be used instead of free-flow speed.
</p>
<p>
The person-hours of delay for commercial vehicles is equal to the vehicle-hours of
delay because the vehicle occupancy of commercial vehicles is 1.
</p>

	<h3>Delay Cost</h3>

The delay cost is found by multiplying the delay for the hour by the value
of a person's time by the vehicle occupancy. Note that this value cannot be
calculated using the total limited volume from Eq. B-8. The delay cost
must be calculated on the volumes derived from the vehicles percentages,
Eq. A-1 and Eq. A-2. To find the combined delay cost, simply take the sum
of both passenger and commercial values.
<p>
Passenger delay cost (Eq. A-6):
</p>
<blockquote class="equation">
	passenger delay cost = passenger vehicle-hours of delay (Eq. A-4) × value of person time × vehicle occupancy
</blockquote>
Commercial delay cost (Eq. A-7):
<blockquote class="equation">
	commercial delay cost = commercial vehicle-hours of delay (Eq. A-4) × commercial vehicle operating cost
</blockquote>
Combined delay cost (Eq. A-8):
<blockquote class="equation">
	combined delay cost = passenger delay cost (Eq. A-6) + commercial delay cost (Eq. A-7)
</blockquote>
After the delay hours and costs are calculated for each TMC segment within a single hour,
they are then summed into one value for that hour of the analysis period. This can only be
done when looking at delay cost, person-hours of delay, and vehicle hours of delay,
as these metrics represent a total for the region and analysis period.
<p>
The delays and costs per VMT represent an average value
over the region and analysis period. These values cannot be calculated at the
individual TMC level and summed up for the entire hour out of the analysis period,
like the totals. Instead, these metrics are calculated from the totals, as shown
below (where i = time interval, j = TMC):
</p>
<p>
Delay per VMT (same for passenger, commercial, and combined vehicle types):
</p>
<p></p>
<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td rowspan="2" class="left-hand">delay per VMT =	</td>
		<td class="numerator">∑<sub>i</sub> ∑<sub>j</sub> delay<sub>ij</sub></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="denominator">∑
		<sub>i</sub> ∑<sub>j</sub> vmt<sub>ij</sub>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Cost per VMT (calculated separately for passenger, commercial, and combined vehicle types):
</p>
<p></p>
<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td rowspan="2" class="left-hand">
		passenger cost per vmt = delay per VMT × passenger delay cost
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p></p>
<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td rowspan="2" class="left-hand">
		commercial cost per vmt = delay per VMT × commercial delay cost
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p></p>
<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td rowspan="2" class="left-hand">
		combined cost per vmt = delay per VMT × (passenger delay cost × (100 - commercial percent of vehicles / 100) + commercial delay cost × (commercial percent of vehicles / 100))
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Note that the commercial percent of vehicles is based on the default passenger and commercial percentages from the report request.

	<h3>Totals Shown on UDC Reports</h3>

Totals for delay cost, person-hours of delay, and vehicle-hours of delay
are found by summing the totals for each hour of the day.
<p>
The daily averages for per VMT metrics are found by taking the sum of the entire day's
delay over the sum of the entire day's VMT. This is meant to give a rough
estimation of what delay per VMT and cost per VMT rates a user experienced traveling any portion of
the roadway at any time of the day.
</p>
<p>
The hourly totals for all delay metrics are a straight sum of the hour they represent.
When looking at per VMT metrics, the hourly average is found by taking the sum of that hour's delay for every day
over the sum of that hour's VMT for every day. This is meant to give a rough
estimation of what delay per VMT and cost per VMT rates a user experienced on any day in the
entire time range at a particular hour.
</p>
<p>
The grand total is a sum of all the daily totals in the report.
When looking at per VMT metrics, the grand average is found by taking the sum of the entire date range's delay over the
sum of the entire date range's VMT. This is meant to give a rough
estimation of what delay per VMT and cost per VMT rates a user experienced at any time during the time range.

	<a name="topic-marker/udc-analysis_how-user-delay-cost-is-calculated_coverage" id="udc-analysis_how-user-delay-cost-is-calculated_coverage"></a>
	<h3>Report Coverage</h3>

<p>
Along with the delay and cost related metrics computed as part of User Delay Cost analysis, a coverage value is also calculated. Coverage represents how many of the expected probe readings were received for each hour of each day. For example, if a report includes 5 segments for a data provider that reports on a 1 minute interval, we would expect to see 300 probe readings for each hour (5 x 60 = 300). If for a given hour there were only 150 readings the coverage for that hour would be 50%.

	<h3>Calculating Cost with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)</h3>

We are now providing per Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) delay metrics.
Delay per vehicle based on volume (<span class="equation">Delay per vehicle = ∑ Delay/ ∑Volume</span>) loses accuracy as the target region grows because it
assumes that a vehicle traverses the entire network.  Delay per user can be calculated with VMT metrics by multiplying a per user VMT rate by our delay per VMT metric.
You can also calculate a cost per user value from multiplying our cost per VMT value with a VMT rate.
<p>
Likewise, cost and delay can be calculated for individual vehicles by multiplying the appropriate distance in miles by the cost per VMT and delay per VMT metrics respectively.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the values below can be used to calculate cost per vehicle, delay per vehicle, as well as the delay and cost of a theoretical trip:
</p>
<p></p><p>
</p><table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<th class="title">Report Values</th>
		<th class="title">User Values</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Delay per VMT: 0.6 hours</td>
		<td>VMT per vehicle: 5 miles / vehicle</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cost per VMT: $10</td>
		<td>Distance of trip: 10 miles</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
<span class="equation">delay per vehicle = delay per VMT × VMT per vehicle = 3 hours per vehicle</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="equation">delay experienced = delay per VMT × Distance of trip = 6 hours</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="equation">cost per vehicle = cost per VMT × VMT per vehicle = $50 per vehicle</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="equation">cost from delay = cost per VMT × Distance of trip = $100</span>
</p>
<p>
If you do not have your own VMT rates, there are statistics available on the <a href="http://nhts.ornl.gov/2009/pub/stt.pdf">National Household Travel Survey</a> and
<a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/state_transportation_statistics/state_transportation_statistics_2011/html/table_05_03.html">USDOT</a> website.

	<h2>User Delay Cost Warnings</h2>

The volume data used to generate these reports has been extracted from a national dataset for average annual daily traffic (AADT) counts at a segment level.
These annual traffic volumes were converted into 15-minute volumes for each day of the average week.
This method produced 15-minute volumes that could be higher or lower than actually experienced on any segment;
however, as larger geographies are analyzed (corridors, subareas, etc) the results will prove reasonably correct.
This national dataset was meant for planning purposes; any analysis that focuses on finite times/dates or on analyses of very short road sections should be approached with caution.
<p>
If your agency wishes to provide additional data to help improve the accuracy of the volume dataset, please contact <a href="mailto:pda-support@ritis.org">pda-support@ritis.org</a> to arrange for the transfer of your data to the University of Maryland. Instructions on how to format your volume data can be found in the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#udc-analysis/preferred-volume-format">Preferred Volume Format</a>

<h2>Speed and Travel Time Table</h2>

The Speed and Travel Time Table can be used to display the
current and historical average speed and travel time along stretches of
road. It can also show the differential between current and historical
performance, helping you monitor at a glance how your segment of road
is doing in comparison to the past.
<p>
The colored boxes encompassing the values shown on the table represent the percentage of current speed or
travel time compared to the historical averages.
</p>
<p>
The following table illustrates the breakdown of the ranges of percentages to color:
</p>
<div class="speed-travel-time-grid">
	<div class="col col-1">&lt; 25%</div>
	<div class="col col-2">25%-55%</div>
	<div class="col col-3">55%-75%</div>
	<div class="col col-4">&gt; 75%</div>
</div>
<p>
The differential column shows how the road is currently performing in relation to
its historical averages. The color and direction of the arrow represent whether this
comparative change is a good or a bad change. It is important to note that the arrow's color
and direction have a different meaning depending on the data type.

<h2>Reliability Table</h2>
<p>
The Reliability Table is a live table widget that displays the peak period reliability <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#data-types_performance-metrics">(Planning Time Index, calculated using either the Free Flow Speed or Posted Speed Limit)</a> of a road or multiple roads. You may select individual roads or a region to view in the resulting table. The table is broken up into 3 columns. You can see the current reliability of the road, the comparative reliability from a prior time period, and the differential of the two. With this information you can see how the selected roads have either increased or decreased in reliability over the course of time.
</p>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<b>Why do different tools have different default hours for their "peak hours" options?</b>
<p>
Our tools serve different audiences and purposes, and depending on who you ask and in what context, the definition of "peak hours" will be different. For example, Travel Time Delta Ranking is designed with arterial analysis in mind, and in that tool 6-9 AM makes sense for the AM peak. Meanwhile, the reliability widget is meant to analyze freeways, where 8-9 AM makes more sense.

<h2>Subpart E: Interstate Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR)</h2>
<p>For each road segment, a cumulative distribution of travel time observations is generated for each of the following time periods:
  </p><ol>
    <li>the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year</li>
    <li>the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year</li>
    <li>the hours of 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year</li>
    <li>the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. for every weekend day (Saturday-Sunday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year</li>
  </ol>
<p></p>
<p>For a given TMC, the LOTTR is calculated as:</p>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/tmc_lottr.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 80px;"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>i = Interstate System reporting segment "i";</p>
<p>The maximum LOTTR for each TMC is used to determine if the TMC is deemed reliable or unreliable. Here, if the maximum TMC LOTTR is &gt;1.5, the segment is deemed unreliable, otherwise, it is considered reliable.</p>
<p>The Overall Interstate l LOTTR for a given geography (State, MPA, or UZA) is computed as:</p>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/overall_lottr.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 60px;"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>R = total number of Interstate System reporting segments that are exhibiting an LOTTR below 1.50 during all of the time periods.</p>
<p>SL<sub>i</sub> = length, to the nearest thousandth of a mile, of System reporting segment "i";</p>
<p>nhs_pct<sub>i</sub> = Percentage of TMC segment "i" length on the NHS</p>
<p>AV<sub>i</sub> = total annual traffic volume to the nearest single vehicle, of the Interstate System reporting segment "i";</p>
<p>j = geographic area in which the reporting segment "i" is located where a unique occupancy factor has been determined;</p>
<p>OF<sub>j</sub> = occupancy factor for vehicles on the NHS within a specified geographic area within the State/Metropolitan planning area. By default, this value is assumed to be 1.67 as recommended by FHWA. States and MPO's are encouraged to provide their locally derived OF factors.

<p>T = total number of Interstate System reporting segments.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Subpart E: Non-Interstate Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR)</h2>
Repeat the procedure described above for Non-Interstate segments.

<h2>Subpart F: Truck Travel Time Reliability (TTTR)</h2>
For a given TMC, the TTTR is calculated as:
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/tmc_tttr.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 80px;"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>i = An Interstate System reporting segment;</p>
<p>The overall TTTR for a given geography (State, MPA, or UZA) is computed as:</p>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/overall_tttr.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 60px;"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p> SL<sub>i</sub> = Segment length, to the nearest thousandth of a mile, of Interstate System reporting segment "i";</p>
<p>nhs_pct<sub>i</sub> = Percentage of TMC segment “i” length on the NHS</p>
<p>T = A total number of Interstate System reporting segments.</p>
<p>maxTTTR<sub>i</sub> = The maximum TTTR of the five time periods defined below, to the nearest hundredth, of Interstate System reporting segment “i”;</p>

</ol>

<h2>Subpart G: Peak Hour Excessive Delay (PHED)</h2>
Excessive delay means the extra amount of time spent in congested conditions defined by speed thresholds that are lower than a normal delay threshold. For the purposes of this rule, the speed threshold is 20 miles per hour (mph) or 60 percent of the posted speed limit, whichever is greater.
<p>Peak Period is defined as weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and either 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. or 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. State DOTs and MPOs may choose whether to use 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. or 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<h3><b><i><u>Step 1: Determine Excessive Delay Threshold Travel Time</u></i></b></h3>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/excessive_delay_threshold_travel_time.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 50px"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>Excessive Delay Threshold Travel Times = the time of travel, to the nearest whole second, to traverse the Travel Time Segment at which any longer measured travel times would result in excessive delay for the travel time segment “s”;</p>
<p>Travel Time Segment Length<sub>s</sub> = total length of travel time segment to the nearest thousandth of a mile for travel time reporting segment “s”; and</p>
<p>Threshold Speed<sub>s</sub> = the speed of travel at which any slower measured speeds would result in excessive delay for travel time reporting segment “s”. The speed threshold is 20 miles per hour or 60 percent of the posted speed limit travel time reporting segment “s”, whichever is greater.</p>

<h3><b><i><u>Step 2: Calculate Excessive Delay</u></i></b></h3>
For each 15-minute bin of each reporting segment for the defined a.m. and p.m. peak periods in a calendar year, calculate the excessive delays as follows:

<h3><b><i><u>Step 2.1: Calculate travel time road segment excessive delay (RSD) in seconds for each 15-minute bin and for each reporting segment </u></i></b></h3>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/rsd.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 40px"></p>
<p>Note that RSDs,b is capped at 900 seconds for each 15-minute time bin.</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>RSD<sub>s,b</sub>  = travel time segment excessive delay, calculated to the nearest whole second, for a 15-minute bin “b” of travel time reporting segment “s” for a day in a calendar year.</p>
<p>Travel time<sub>s,b</sub> =  the measured travel time (to the nearest second) for 15-minute time bin “b” recorded for travel time reporting segment “s”;</p>
<p>Excessive Delay Threshold Travel Time<sub>s</sub> = the time to traverse (to the nearest whole second) Travel Time Segment “s” at the Threshold Speed (see <i>Step 1</i>);</p>
<p>b = a 15-minute bin of a travel time reporting segment “s”; and</p>
<p>s = a travel time reporting segment.</p>

<h3><b><i><u>Step 2.2: Calculate excessive delay in hours for each 15-minute bin and for each reporting segment </u></i></b></h3>
Excessive delay is calculated to the nearest thousandths of an hour as follows:
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/excessive_delay.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Excessive Delay<sub>s,b</sub> =  excessive delay, calculated to the nearest thousandths of an hour, for 15-minute bin “b” of travel time reporting segment “s”;</p>
<p>RSD<sub>s,b</sub> = the calculated travel time reporting segment delay for fifteen minute bin “b” of a travel time reporting segment “s,”;</p>
<p>b = a 15-minute bin of a travel time reporting segment “s”; and</p>
<p>s = a travel time reporting segment.</p>

<h3><b><i><u>Step 3: Total excessive delay (in –person hours) on each segment </u></i></b></h3>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/total_excessive_delay.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 200px;"></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>Total Excessive Delays (in person-hours) = the sum of the excessive delay, to the nearest thousandths, for all traffic traveling through single travel time reporting segment “s” on NHS within an urbanized area, accumulated over the full reporting year.</p>
<p>AVO = Average Vehicle Occupancy;</p>
<p>s = a travel time reporting segment;</p>
<p>d = a day of the reporting year;</p>
<p>TD = total number of days in the reporting year;</p>
<p>h = single hour interval of the day where the first hour interval is 12 a.m. to 12:59 a.m.;</p>
<p>TH = total number of hour intervals in day “h”;</p>
<p>b = 15-minute bin for hour interval “h”;</p>
<p>TB = total number of 15-minute bins where travel times are recorded in the travel time data set for hour interval “h”;</p>
<p>nhs_pct<sub>i</sub> = Percentage of TMC segment “i” length on the NHS</p>
<p>Excessive Delay<sub>s,b,h,d</sub> = calculated excessive travel time, in hundredths of an hour, for 15-minute bin (b), hour interval (h), day (d), and travel time segment (s);</p>
<p>Hourly volume = rounded to the nearest tenth of a vehicle for hour interval “h” and day “d” that corresponds to 15-minute bin “b” and travel time reporting segment “s” divided by 4. The hourly volume profiles can be downloaded <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/TTI%2060-minute%20volume%20profile%20lookup.xlsx">HERE</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">AVO = (PC × AVOC) + (PB × AVOB) + (PT × AVOT)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>AVOC = the average vehicle occupancy of cars;</p>
<p>AVOB = the average vehicle occupancy of buses; and</p>
<p>AVOT = the average vehicle occupancy of trucks.</p>
<p>PC = the percent of cars as a share of total AADT on the segment. Unless provided by agencies, this value is estimated using the HPMS data items in the following equation:  </p>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/PC.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 40px;"></p>
<p>PB = the percent of buses as a share of total AADT on the segment. Unless provided by agencies, the bus volume is estimated using the HPMS data item “AADT_Single_Unit” as a proxy. The bus percentage is calculated using the following equation:</p>
<p><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/PB.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 40px;"></p>
<p>PT = the percent of trucks as a share of total AADT on the segment. Unless provided by agencies, the truck volume is estimated using the HPMS data item “AADT_Combination” as a proxy. The truck percentage is calculated using the following equation:</p>

<h2>User Delay Cost Table</h2>
<p>
  The User Delay Cost Widget can be used to show the estimated trend in vehicle hours of delay or delay cost at the monthly level.
</p>
<p>
  The user can select the years of data to include as well as the roads or region to include in each widget. Users can also apply the default percent of passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles and their respective value of time.
</p>
<p>
  The widget displays the available data up to the most recent full month available. The date displayed in the bottom right corner of the widget presents the date in which new data was added to the table.

<h2>Ranked Bottleneck Comparison</h2>
<p>
When you create a Ranked Bottleneck Comparison widget, a ranked table of the current month’s worst bottlenecked locations will be generated.
</p>
<p>
Along with this month’s ranking, the bottlenecked locations will be ranked for selected prior months as well. You may notice that some locations don’t have a rank in prior months. This is because the location may not have been as much of a problem earlier in the year.
</p>
<p>
The Ranked Bottleneck Comparison widget is a live widget, so every month it will update with a new set of locations based on severity.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/dashboard-rbc-diagram.png" alt="Dashboard ranked bottleneck comparison diagram">
</p>
<p>
From the widget query form, you have the option to choose a specific road or region to monitor as well as the number of bottlenecked locations you would like rank.

	<a name="topic-marker/dashboard_event-count" id="dashboard_event-count"></a>
	
<h2>Event Count</h2>
<p>
The Event Count widget displays the number of events grouped by type that occurred during a given time, updating every 15 minutes.
When creating an Event Count widget, you can choose an event or incident data source and a list of types to be displayed. As an optional selection, you can filter by location for where the events occurred.
You can group event counts between two different event types: the standardized event type,
consistent event types developed by CATT Lab for all roads and regions; or the
agency event type, the event types provided by the selected agency.
</p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/dashboard-event-count-query-form.png" alt="Event Count query form">

<p>
The widget is broken up into two sections: the event count bar chart, and the event count pie chart. Both data visualizations provide event counts of
the two time periods that are being compared. You can hover over the bar chart to see event count details for specific event types and pin their selection by clicking.
With this information you can better understand how the number of events occurring in your agency changes over time.

	<a name="topic-marker/dashboard_clearance-time" id="dashboard_clearance-time"></a>
	
<h2>Clearance Time</h2>
<p>
  The Clearance Time widget helps agencies who are interested in seeing how quickly they are clearing events over time.
  It includes three different visualizations that can be used to analyze clearance time from different perspectives:
  the Clearance Time Matrix, Distribution Chart, and Box and Whisker Chart.
</p>
<p>
  When creating a Clearance Time widget, you can choose which agency's event data you want to analyze, any geographic
  restrictions you want to apply, whether or not you want to use the RITIS standard types or the selected agency's
  specific types for grouping events by type, and which subset of the types you want included in your analysis. Because
  roadwork events are not often considered for a DOT's quick clearance goals, the default selection in the standardized
  types drop down excludes roadwork events.
</p>
<p>
  You can also choose temporal restrictions, including the times of day and days of week you want to analyze and how
  many years (up to 3) you want to compare.
</p>
<p>
  Once added to your dashoard, the Clearance Time widget will refresh its data every hour.
</p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/dashboard-clearance-time-query-form.png" alt="Clearance Time widget query form">

<h3>Clearance Time Matrix</h3>
<p>
  The Clearance Time Matrix displays the average clearance time of the events that match your Clearance Time widget's
  filters on a month-by-month basis. The cells for months with a lower average clearance time are colored green while
  months with a higher average clearance time are colored red.
</p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/dashboard-clearance-time-clearance-time-matrix.png" alt="Clearance Time Matrix">

<h3>Distribution Chart</h3>
<p>
  The Distribution Chart shows the number of events cleared within specific amounts of time.
  This is useful for seeing if your agency is hitting their quick clearance goals year-to-year.
</p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/dashboard-clearance-time-distribution-chart.png" alt="Clearance Time Distribution Chart">

<h3>Box and Whisker Chart</h3>
<p>
  The Box and Whisker Chart shows the 5th percentile, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and 95th percentile clearance time per
  event type on a year-to-year basis. This information can help you understand the proportion of events that are getting
  closed sooner rather than later and help you recognize the presence of outliers.

<h2>Energy Use and Emissions Table</h2>
<p>Energy Use and Emissions Table allows you to create tables that are updated in real-time, displaying energy use and emissions
data for any roads or regions of interest. The dashboard widget editor is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/ee-table-widget-editor.png" alt="ee-table-widget-editor" class="ee-table-widget-editor">
<figcaption>Energy Use and Emissions Table Widget Editor</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Within the widget editor, you can select the desired analysis segments (see our <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#selecting-roads">Road Selection Help
Section</a> for more assistance), the metrics to include in the table, the reference time periods, and a configurable table
name (optional). The metrics available include energy use from either the Route-E or the Bayesian Model, CO<sub>2</sub>, NOX,
PM, PM2.5, PM2.5NOX, and VOC. All of the emissions estimates are derived from the Bayesian model. Next, you can select one or
more reference points to compare the real-time data against. The first option is historical data for the same road segments
from the previous year that is averaged for each time of day and day of week. The second option is a predictive reference point
that project energy use and emissions using the Bayesian model. Predictive metrics are not available under the Route-E model.
Lastly you can name the dashboard, otherwise a default title will be assigned. Upon clicking the "+ Add widget" button the new
widget will be added to the Dashboard.
</p>
<p>
As shown in the figure below, the widget presents the requested metrics in a tabular format. In this example, all available
metrics for six analysis road selections have been selected. Note that only four of the metrics are shown in the figure below,
as you would need to scroll to the right to view the other metrics. The table includes a column for these selections, as well
as grouped columns for each of the requested metrics that provide the real-time metric estimate next to the selected reference
metrics (historical and predicted metric 2.5 hours in the future). Within the table, the energy estimates are provided in
BTU/minute units, while the emissions are in tons/minute. To help you identify abnormal energy or emissions, a blue and red
coloring schema is used to highlight changes of at least 5%. Here the current conditions are referenced to the historical
conditions, while the predictive conditions are references to the current conditions. Blue cells indicate a decrease of at
least 5% while the red cells indicate an increase of at least 5%. The table updates every five minutes and the update status
is provided in the bottom right corner of the widget. Meanwhile, the data source behind the metrics is presented in the bottom
left corner of the widget. Lastly, the functions to save as Excel, edit, close, or access the help page can be found in the
widget's top right corner.

<h1>Travel Time Delta Ranking</h1>

<p>The Travel Time Delta Ranking tool allows you to rank and compare the change in performance of corridors between two time periods. This provides before-and-after comparison primarily intended for corridor performance improvement projects, but can be used for analyzing changes along one or more roadways between any two time periods.</p>
<p>Start by selecting the corridor(s) and the two time periods you're interested in. You can also choose specific times of day to include for analysis within the specified time periods. The default is 6-9AM and 4-7 PM.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-query-form.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-query-form.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>
<p>
You can <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#data-types/providing-your-signal-data">provide us with signal data</a> for this tool.
</p>

<h2>Ranking Table</h2>
<p>Once the results are computed, you'll see several visualizations designed to help you analyze the results. The ranking table will show your queried corridors ranked by performance. Corridor performance is measured by change in median travel time and interquartile range (IQR) to assess reliability. The "Δ Median" and "Δ IQR" columns show the difference between the before and after values for median travel time and IQR respectively. Medians and IQRs are shown as a percent of speed limit travel time so that results are normalized. Reference speed is used on segments where speed limit data is not provided.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-ranking-table.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-ranking-table.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>

<p>The two panels below the ranking table house the other visualizations available in Travel Time Delta Ranking. You can choose which visualization is shown in each panel by using the drop down in the top left corner of each panel.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-drop-down.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-drop-down.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>

<h2>Map</h2>
<p>
  The map shows all corridors that have their "Map" checkbox selected on the ranking table and the selected corridor. The selected corridor from the table is drawn thicker on the map to help you identify it among the other mapped corridors. Each road is colored based on a combination of its Δ Median and Δ IQR metrics.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Green: Both values indicating improvement</li>
    <li>Red: Both values indicating degraded performance</li>
    <li>Yellow: One metric indicates improvement but the other indicates degraded performance, or both metrics are unchanged.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The corridor ranks and associated traffic signals also appear on the map, unless configured otherwise in Display Options.
  </p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-map.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/delta-ranking-map.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>

<h2>Slope Chart</h2>
<p>The slope chart plots the median travel time and IQR on opposing axes. Each corridor with a change in either metric is rendered as an arrow with a circle plotted at the point represented by the "Median Before" and "IQR Before" values leading to an arrowhead plotted at the point represented by the "Median After" and "IQR After" values. As a result, green lines that slope down and to the left indicate corridors trending better in both median travel time and IQR between the two periods.  Red lines that slope up and to the right indicate corridors trending worse in both metrics. Yellow lines that slope in other directions indicate a mixed result. If there is no significant change between the two periods, a corridor is plotted as a single yellow circle.</p>

<h1>Travel Time Comparison</h1>

<p>The Travel Time Comparison tool allows you to compare travel time distributions on a selected pair of corridors during specified times of day.</p>
<p>Start by selecting up to 2 corridors, then up to 7 date ranges.  You can also choose up to 3 times of day to include for analysis within the specified 
date ranges. The default is 6-9 AM and 4-7 PM.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-query-form.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-query-form.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>

<p>When your results have loaded, you will see a line chart for each corridor and each time of day you selected, and a different colored line for each 
date range. The charts represent the cumulative distributions of travel times for the given corridor, date range, and time of day. There is also a 
reference line for the speed limit travel time. PDA will use reference speed if speed limit data is not provided for any segment included in your results.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-charts.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-charts.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>

<p>If you mouse over any chart, a tooltip will pop up with the travel time values for each line at the percentile. The chart key shows the colors that 
correspond to each date range. You can click on each line in the key to change the color that shows on the graphs. You can also uncheck date ranges here if you’d like to hide them from the charts.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-tooltips.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-tooltips.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>

<p>The map to the right shows the corridors you selected and any traffic signals along those corridors if PDA has traffic signal data for your region.</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-map.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/travel-time-comparison-map.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>
<p>You can use the display options to provide a custom range for travel times on the charts, hide the map, hide the traffic signals on the map, toggle 
when chart tooltips display, or hide individual charts. By default, the chart tooltips enable tooltips for charts sharing the same direction, but you 
also have the option of just displaying one chart's tooltip at a time.

<h2>Interpreting cumulative distribution charts</h2>
<p>There are two primary components of cumulative distribution charts that can be used to interpret the severity of congestion and travel time reliability. The severity of 
congestion can be evaluated by examining the relative position of the distribution along the x-axis. Shifting a given curve to the left suggests improved congestion through reduced 
travel times. This concept is illustrated in the figure below:</p>


<a href="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/distribution-chart-congestion.png" target="_blank"><img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/distribution-chart-congestion.png" style="max-width:100%"></a>
<p>Next, travel time reliability can be evaluated by examining the spread of the distribution across the x-axis. Large x-axis ranges (i.e. a flatter curve with lower slope) can be 
generally interpreted as having lower reliability relative to a distribution with small x-axis ranges (i.e. a sharper more vertical curve). The figure below illustrates this concept:</p>

<h1>Causes of Congestion Graphs</h1>

<p>Building on <a href="https://ritis.org/archive/congestion">Congestion Causes</a>, a dashboard showing congestion causes on national, statewide, and countywide levels, Causes of Congestion Graphs allows you to assess similar metrics on custom road and date selections. Congestion data will be processed on a weekly basis which will result in a 8 to 10 day lag for it to become available within the tool.</p>

<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/ccg-query-form.png" style="max-width:900px">

<p>The query form allows you to specify:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Road segments of interest</li>
  <li>Date range of interest</li>
  <li>Days of week filters</li>
  <li>Hours of day filters (up to three can be entered)</li>
  <li>Value of time for passenger and commercial vehicles (National averages are used by default). For more information on the costs and how they are used, including more information on the occupancy constant, please refer to <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#udc-analysis">User Delay Cost Analysis</a>.</li>
  <li>Title of report (optional, appears in My History and at the top of the Causes of Congestion Graphs result page)</li>
  <li>Notes (optional, for documenting any notes related to the query)</li>
</ol>

<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/ccg-results-pie-chart.png" style="max-width:900px">

<p>Once the query has been processed, you can explore the outputs on the results page. The left side of the page presents a summary of the report parameters, including the road selection, date range and other temporal filters, average cost of delay of passenger and commercial vehicles used to estimate user delay cost, and the breakdown of passenger and commercial vehicles by percent of total vehicles. Unless specified in the agency-provided volume data, all delay cost estimates assume a vehicle classification of 90% passenger vehicles and 10% commercial vehicles. Below the report parameters is a delay and cost summary that provides the vehicle hours of delay and associated delay costs.</p>

<p>The center section of the result page displays the breakdown of the causes of congestion as a bar chart, a pie chart, or a table. You can switch between the different chart types using the buttons in the top-left corner of this section.</p>

<h2>Methodology Summary</h2>

<p>
  The analysis steps for producing the data behind Causes of Congestion Graphs can be generalized as the identification, quantification, and categorization of congestion. The generalized process is conceptualized in the figure below.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/tdads-analysis-steps.png" style="max-width:900px">
  <figcaption>Generalized causes of congestion analysis steps</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Further details on the causes of congestion methodology are provided in the data flow diagram and logic diagram below.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/tdads-analysis-flow.png" style="max-width:900px">
  <figcaption>Causes of congestion data flow and logic diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  As shown in the above figures, the basis of the causes of congestion methodology begins with identifying when and where congestion occurs. As described in detail in the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#bottleneck-ranking">Bottleneck Ranking section</a>, congestion is defined as an observed speed that is 60% or less of the free-flow speed.  Such events that last less than 5 minutes are ignored in this analysis.  For each minute of a given bottleneck's existence, delays are computed over the queue at that time (the set of contiguous road-segments behind the bottleneck head, until a segment is found which is not congested).  The Vehicle-Hours-of-Delay are computed each minute for each bottleneck as a function of current speed, free-flow speed, and historical traffic volume for that stretch of road.  When the bottleneck's head location is not found to be congested any longer, the bottleneck is closed and final VHD values are saved for that congestion event.
</p>
<p>
  The last step is to assign the total delay for each bottleneck to a causation category. As shown in the data flow diagram and logic diagram, this process begins by looking at the temporal congestion pattern. If the delay magnitude is similar to the historical magnitude for the time of day and day of week of the given bottleneck, the bottleneck is categorized as a recurrent bottleneck. However, if the delay magnitude is greater than normal, additional causation causes are considered. In a similar fashion, if the congestion is deemed non-recurrent, causes are assessed including multiple causes as well as an unclassified category for instances when a cause could not be determined. Each bottleneck is assigned to a causation category, and based on search criteria in a given request, the congestion events which match the given spatial and temporal filters will be aggregated together resulting in a total VHD associated with each cause of combination-of-causes. Causes that contribute less than 0.01% of the total delay are excluded from results.
</p>

<h2>Additional Methodology Remarks</h2>

<h3>Assigning Delay to Bottlenecks That Straddle Temporal or Spatial Boundaries</h3>

<p>
  When doing spatial matching of congestion events to determine which are aggregated into the returned VHD sums, only the head location of each bottleneck is matched.  However, when doing cause-matching the full-queue is frequently considered as it is deemed that an incident or weather event not located right at the bottleneck head may not have caused the congestion event in its entirety, it may still have contributed to the total Vehicle Hours of Delay being greater based on slowing down traffic in the back of the queue, or extending the queue-length further than it would have otherwise spanned.
</p>
<p>
  When doing temporal matching, the start-time of the congestion event is used to determine whether the event occurs within the requested time span, but when filtering by time-of-day, for instance 7am to 9am, any congestion events that overlap that time window are included in the results.

<h1>NPMRDS FAQs</h1>

<h2>What is the NPMRDS?</h2>
<p>
The National Performance Management Research Data Set (NPMRDS) is a vehicle probe-based travel time data set acquired by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for its use in various
performance measurement programs, such as its Freight Performance Measures, Urban Congestion Report, and other programs. The NPMRDS is also provided to state departments of transportation
(DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) for their performance management activities.
</p><p>
The NPMRDS is an archived speed and travel time data set (including associated location referencing data) that covers the
<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/Planning/national_highway_system/" target="_blank">National Highway System (NHS)</a> and additional roadways near 26 key border crossings with Canada
(20 crossings) and Mexico (6 crossings).
</p><p>
Three data sets are available as part of the NPMRDS that include speeds and travel times at 5 minute intervals on over 400,000 road segments for:
</p><ul class="tight">
  <li>Passenger vehicles</li>
  <li>Trucks</li>
  <li>Trucks and Passenger vehicles combined</li>
</ul><p></p><p>
New NPMRDS data becomes available each week. NPMRDS data from 2011 through January 31, 2017 were provided by HERE.
A separate set of NPMRDS data from January 1, 2016 forward is provided by a team consisting of the CATT Lab at the University of Maryland (UMD), INRIX, 1Spatial, the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute (TTI), and KMJ
Consulting - collectively referred to as the UMD team.
</p>

<h2>Who can use the NPMRDS?</h2>
<p>
The NPMRDS can be used by individuals from federal agencies, DOTs, MPOs, and authorized organizations working under contract to these agencies. Each organization must execute a Data
Sharing Agreement (DSA) to gain access to the NPMRDS data portal - "NPMRDS Analytics." An agency may grant a contractor the right to use the data for work performed for the agency as
defined in the data sharing agreement.
</p>

<h2>Who supports the NPMRDS program?</h2>
<p>
The NPMRDS from January 2016 onward is put together by a team consisting of:
</p><ul class="tight">
  <li><a href="http://www.cattlab.umd.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Maryland Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory (CATT Lab)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.inrix.com/" target="_blank">INRIX</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://1spatial.com/" target="_blank">1Spatial</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://tti.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute (TTI)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://kmjinc.com/" target="_blank">KMJ Consulting, Inc. (KMJ)</a></li>
</ul><p></p><p>
INRIX is responsible for creating the NPMRDS dataset of calculated speeds and travel times for over 400,000 specific road segments across the NPMRDS Road Network
for every 5-minutes of each day. INRIX leverages its existing source data that includes millions of connected vehicles, trucks, and mobile devices that anonymously
supply location and movement data that is used by INRIX to generate real-time traffic speeds and travel times across the nation's key roadways. INRIX has implemented
a special process to create the NPMRDS dataset: a path-processing algorithm described in detail in this document to meet NPMRDS requirements using its existing
source data. The NPMRDS dataset is based on actual reported vehicle data, exclusively - no imputation is included. Path-processing is utilized because it allows for
better use of the underlying source data to maximize road coverage and increases the accuracy of reported speeds and travel times on many of the non-interstate NHS
facilities. (See the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/NPMRDS.pdf">NPMRDS Descriptive Metadata Document</a> (PDF) for more details.
</p><p>
The CATT Lab hosts the NPMRDS on its RITIS platform at <a href="https://npmrds.ritis.org/">npmrds.ritis.org</a>, making the data easy to download at user-defined
geographies and temporal resolutions. This site includes a suite of tools you can use to interpret the data, visualize data availability, and produce MAP-21
reports. Researchers at the CATT Lab are also responsible for validating the NPMRDS.
</p><p>
1Spatial and the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute provides technical support for HPMS and TMC conflation, and produces the national and state GIS shapefiles and associated meta data.
</p><p>
KMJ Consulting Inc. supports the CATT Lab with helpdesk, documentation, and other user support.
</p>

<h2>How does the NPMRDS differ from other probe-based speed and travel time data sources?</h2>
<p>
The NPMRDS is procured by the FHWA specifically to help state and local governments with performance measures research. It is the baseline dataset used to meet the
federal congestion and freight performance reporting regulations (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tpm/rule.cfm" target="_blank">PM3</a>). It is provided free of
charge to DOTs and MPOs and to groups working on behalf of DOTs and MPOs.
</p><ul class="tight">
  <li>The NPMRDS data is available at 5 minute intervals.</li>
  <li>The NPMRDS does not use imputed data; "null" records are included in the NPMRDS when probes are not present during a given 5 minute epoch.</li>
  <li>The NPMRDS is not a real-time data set. Data is published every week, with each delivery containing a week's worth of data (Monday to Sunday). This data is generally published on Tuesday, nine to ten days after the end of each data week. Additionally, the entirety of the previous month is made available on the fifth business day of the following month.</li>
  <li>The NPMRDS is only available for the NHS and select roadways near 26 key border crossings with Canada (20 crossings) and Mexico (6 crossings).</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h2>What is the expanded NPMRDS / Full TMC Network?</h2>
<p>
As discussed above, the NPMRDS provides data only for segments that are on the National Highway System (NHS). However, agencies may elect to expand the NPMRDS to the
Full TMC Network for their geographies, thereby adding speed and travel time data for all segments for which the vendor (INRIX) processes data. (Generally speaking,
expanding the NPMRDS to the full TMC network roughly doubles the number of segments with speed and travel time data). Speed data for the full TMC network are created
using the same procedural rules as the NPMRDS, producing travel times in the same format as the NPMRDS.

<h2>How can I access the NPMRDS?</h2>
<p>
Access to NPMRDS data from January 2017 forward is available after signing the data-sharing agreement at <a href="https://npmrds.ritis.org/dsa">npmrds.ritis.org/dsa</a>.
A representative from your agency must execute the data-sharing agreement.
Authorized agencies include federal agencies, DOTs, MPOs, and organizations working under contract to these groups.
</p><p>
Once an agency is registered, individuals from that agency (employees and contractors) can register for an account at <a href="https://ritis.org/register/">ritis.org/register</a>.
</p><p>
Data is made available through the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#massive-data-downloader">Massive Data Downloader (MDD)</a> on a weekly basis (Monday to Sunday), about ten days after the week ends. Furthermore, entire months are made available on the fifth business day after the month ends. Individual users from eligible organizations register for unique account credentials to access the NPMRDS MDD - eligible organizations must have a
fully executed NPMRDS DSA. The NPMRDS MDD will provide several options for users to tailor data extraction to meet their needs and reduce the amount of superfluous data provided.
Options include the ability to download data in 5-minute or 15-minute intervals. The 15-minute option provides data to State DOTs and MPOs that directly supports calculating the
federally-required congestion and freight measures as defined in subparts E, F, and G of 23 CFR 490.
</p><p>
NPMRDS data from October 2011 through January 2017 is available within npmrds.ritis.org but only to users who executed a data sharing agreement before June 2017.
</p><p>
See our <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/NPMRDSquickstart.pdf">quick start guide</a> for more details on how to access the NPMRDS.
</p>

<h2>What's changed in the NPMRDS as of January 2017?</h2>
<p>
The following list highlights some of the new features available in NPMRDS starting in 2017:
</p><ul class="tight">
  <li>Uses path-processing which results in higher data quality and coverage</li>
  <li>Includes a sample size indicator for each vehicle type which specifies the number of reporting devices contributing to the speed and travel time record</li>
  <li>Includes epochs filled with nulls for better data management</li>
  <li>Is available within five business days after the end of each month</li>
  <li>Adheres to the following monthly data completeness commitments:
    <ul class="tight">Interstate Truck Coverage - Total: 60%
      <li>Interstate Truck Coverage - Peak (M-F, 6a-8p): 70%</li>
      <li>Interstate All-Vehicles - Total: 75%</li>
      <li>Interstate All-Vehicles - Peak: 85%</li>
      <li>Non-Interstate All Vehicles - Total: 25%</li>
      <li>Non-Interstate All Vehicles - Peak: 35%</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Contains TMC Path and HPMS Segment Conflation which results in accurate location referencing</li>
  <li>Includes separate travel times on internal and external TMC paths</li>
  <li>Includes new fields including UTC timestamps and data density for all vehicle types</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h2>Why did the number of TMCs in my region change in February of 2017 with the NPMRDS?</h2>
<p>
There are a number of factors that could account for the change.
The earlier NPMRDS data combined internal and external TMC segment pairs into a single record.
Therefore, the new NPMRDS will likely include additional segments on the NHS.
</p><p>
Furthermore, there might be a difference in which roads (and road segments) were considered
part of the National Highway System in the prior NPMRDS when compared with the new NPMRDS.
</p>

<h2>How do I download the NPMRDS data?</h2>
<p>
Customized data downloads are available through the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#massive-data-downloader">Massive Data Downloader</a>. When your export is complete, you will receive an email with a link to

<h2>How large are the NPMRDS files?</h2>
<p>
The size of your export depends on the complexity of the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#massive-data-downloader/requests">request you submitted</a>. In the main readings file, each row will
include a TMC and a timestamp. The timestamps will be in intervals between 5 minutes and 1 hour, depending on what you requested in the averaging option.
</p><p>
For example, consider a report for all of I-95 from Florida to Maine. Let's look at a report for a single day (Feb 1, 2017, in this case). The NPMRDS has 3,018 TMCs along
3,643 miles of roadway. If you select 1-hour averaging, your report will have 24 rows for each of 3,018 TMCs. That's 72,432 rows (636 KB). If you request "Don't average"
as your averaging, you'll get 12 times as much data: 869,184 rows (5,303KB). You can often reduce the filesize by unchecking the null record handling option.
</p><p>
When viewed in a spreadsheet program (such as Excel), the data will look like this:
</p><p>
</p><table class="preserve">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>tmc_code</th><th>measurement_tstamp</th><th>speed</th><th>travel_time_minutes</th><th>data_density</th></tr>

Exports results are available for download for one week after they are complete. However, the exports will remain listed in your <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#myhistory">My History</a> page.
Once they're shown as expired, they will include a "Run this again" link so you can easily re-run the export using the same parameters.
</p>

<h2>Can I download data averaged every X minutes?</h2>
<p>
The NPMRDS data is stored in 5-minute bins, but the Massive Data Downloader tool lets you aggregate the data
in 10-, 15-, 30-, or 60-minute bins to help reduce the size of your results document.
</p><p>
When we aggregate the data:
</p><ul>
  <li>The timestamp represents the beginning of the chosen interval</li>
  <li>Speed are calculated using the harmonic mean of the 5-minute values that fall within the granularity bin you choose.</li>
  <li>Travel times are calculated by dividing the length of the segment by the calculated speed.</li>
  <li>Data Density is derived from the minimum possible number of reporting vehicles in each 5-minute epoch. For example, if you choose to average in 15-minute segments, we use the
    data density values from the three 5-minute bins. Here are 3 possible combinations for a 15-minute segment:
    <p>
    </p><table class="preserve">
      <thead>
        <tr><th colspan="3">Source data density</th><th>Calculated data density</th></tr>

      <tbody>
        <tr><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">A</td><td>A (3 reporting vehicles is the lowest possible total)</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">B</td><td>B (7 reporting vehicles is the lowest possible total)</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">B</td><td align="center">B</td><td>C (11 reporting vehicles is the lowest possible total)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul><p></p>

<h2>Why can't I select certain dates in the Massive Data Downloader?</h2>
<p>
While NPMRDS data is available starting as early as 2011, NPMRDS V.2 (which began in January of 2017) is governed by a new contract and new data sharing agreement.
</p><p>
If you can't select the NPMRDS datasource for dates after February 1, 2017, you should request access by reaching out to <a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a>. Your agency
will first need to sign and submit a <a href="https://npmrds.ritis.org/dsa">data sharing agreement</a>. Once this is completed and verified, your RITIS account will be updated to reflect
the expanded date range. This process may take up to two business days. See our <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/NPMRDSquickstart.pdf">quick start guide</a> for more details on how to
access the NPMRDS.
</p>

<h2>How often is the NPMRDS updated and released?</h2>
<p>Data is published every week, with each delivery containing a week's worth of data (Monday to Sunday).  This data is generally published on Tuesday, nine to ten days after the end of each data week. Additionally, the entirety of the previous month is made available on the fifth business day of the following month.</p>

<h2>How is the highway system segmented in the NPMRDS?</h2>
<p>
The NPMRDS uses the TMC (Traffic Message Channel) standard to identify road segments. Each segment (TMC) is uniquely identified by a "TMC code", consisting of nine characters. For more
information on how TMC codes are assigned, see the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#tmcs">TMC</a> Codes help page.
</p>

<h2>How is conflation done to merge the TMC network and the HPMS network?</h2>
<p>You can read about the conflation process <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/Conflation%20Guide.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Where can I find documentation explaining how to use shapefiles?</h2>
<p>
The shapefiles use Esri's shapefile standard — see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> or
the <a href="https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf" target="_blank">Esri Shapefile Technical Description</a> for more information.
The <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/#data-types">Data types</a> help page describes all the attributes that are available.
</p>

<h2>What if I find an error in the shapefiles?</h2>
<p>Please report any issues with the shapefile to <a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a>.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between a speed of "null" and a speed of "0"?</h2>
<p>
When a record in the NPMRDS has a speed of "null", that indicates that no probes were present at the particular location and time represented by that record. When a record has a speed of 0,
that indicates that probes were present but they were not moving.
</p>

<h2>How can I get more information?</h2>
<p>
See the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/NPMRDS.pdf">NPMRDS Descriptive Metadata Document</a> (PDF) for complete technical details.<br>
Any further questions or requests for technical assistance can be sent to <a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>Can I remove these ____ TMC segments that are not NHS?</h2>
<p>
In some cases a single TMC segment contains multiple HPMS segments; some of which are NHS and some that are not. While some TMCs are only partial NHS (nhs_pct less than 10%) we still do not
remove them as we would lose NHS segments and data.
</p>

<h2>Can I add TMC segments for these ____ NHS routes?</h2>
<p>
NHS routes must be designated in HPMS (provided by each state DOT and compiled by the FHWA) and must be encoded in TMC network and then are conflated into the "Joint Map" that NPMRDS uses.
TMC segments can and are added and improved with each update but it takes time as the HPMS and the TMC network must both be individually updated and then carefully conflated (a very
intricate process) to create precise maps and tools that produce accurate results.
</p>

<h2>Can I change the road name attribute (or other attribute values)?</h2>
<p>
As TMC attributes are managed by The North American TMC Code Alliance and HPMS attributes are reported by each state DOT there is a very deliberate procedure for assigning road names to
each road segment. We are working on versioning labels so that it's more clear what you are getting when you download the shapefiles or use the TMC_Identification.csv file. For more
information on how specific data is currently formatted see the "How is the data from the Massive Data Downloader formatted?" section.
</p>

<h2>What is the conflation update schedule for future years?</h2>
<p>
The schedule is largely dependent on HPMS release from FHWA, contract renewals, and the extensive conflation process. That said, at this time the NPMRDS network is updated once per year to
reflect updated those HPMS attributes, and between the annual HPMS updates, there are typically 1-2 updates to reflect improvements/refinements (such as removing non-NHS that were
incorrectly conflated).
</p>

<h2>Why don't my 2012-2016 results match up with 2017?</h2>
<p>
The primary difference in 2017 data vs previous data is that we 'point-pair' our GPS data instead of using instantaneous GPS speeds (which can be highly variable on arterials). More details
can be found <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/NPMRDS.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>

<h2>I have found an error in the NPMRDS for my state/agency, how can I get it fixed?</h2>
<p>
The NPMRDS team uses the HPMS NHS file from <u>2 years prior</u>. Therefore, if you are comparing something newer it will probably be wrong. While this is not ideal, it is the reality of
the process we currently have. So for example, the 2017 NPMRDS is based on the 2015 HPMS and the 2018 NPMRDS used the 2016 HPMS. There are several possible sources of errors in the NPMRDS
and each one requires a different process to correct the error. Errors can come from the HPMS Shapefile (geographic location and associated data), the TMC Shapefile (geographic location
and associated data) or the actual conflation product of the two shapefiles, the NPMRDS Shapefile.
</p>

<h2>How do I request the addition of missing road segments or the removal of excess road segments?</h2>
<p>
There are two shapefiles that need to be checked, the HPMS Shapefile and the TMC Map. If the missing/erroneous segment is present in both the HPMS Shapefile and the TMC Shapefile correctly,
then there is a problem with the conflation and a request should be made to the <a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a> email stating a problem was found with the conflation
along with associated details. If a segment of road is missing or out of place from the HPMS Shapefile, a correction needs to be requested with FHWA's Highway System Performance Division
through your state HPMS submission process and the FHWA representative (as required). If the section of road is missing from the TMC Shapefile a request for correction needs to be submitted
to <a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a> so it can be submitted to the appropriate agency as a map update request via FHWA (UMD will forward requests to FHWA). In all
cases, updates may not be accomplished until the next round of conflation.

<h2>What are overlapping TMCs?</h2>
<p>
Due to TMC mapping there may be some TMCs that have segment portions that overlap. Please see below for an example of this:
</p><p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/overlapping_roadsigns_1.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
</p><p>
These overlapping TMCs can be identified in the NPMRDS Shapefile where the "IsPrimary" field is "0"; non-overlapping TMCs have a "IsPrimary" value of "1". You may also see examples where
there TMCs overlap, but there is no underlying TMC where isPrimary=0. See below image:
</p><p>
<img src="./The Probe Data Analytics Suite Help_files/overlapping_roadsigns_2.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
</p><p>
In this case the TMCs will overlap and this needs to be taken into account when doing mileage calculations. We cannot remove, change or mark these partially overlapping TMCs as Primary = 0
because this will create a gap in the TMC coverage. Please see below for an example.

</p>

<h2>Why do I have excess NHS mileage in my state or MPO compared to my HPMS submission?</h2>
<p>
TMCs rarely match exactly to the HPMS NHS segmentation so in many cases there is only a percentage of a TMC length that is attributable to the NHS. The entire length of the TMC is included
because that is what the travel time data is based on. To determine the total NHS mileage users must multiply the TMC length attribute "Miles" by the "nhs_pct" attribute and sum this across
an area to get a representative "NHS" mileage statistic.
</p>

<h2>The TMC covers more than the associated NHS, can I remove part of the TMC so it matches the NHS portion of the road?</h2>
<p>
No. A TMC will not be split because that is how the travel times are reported. If the TMCs were sub divided on the map the corresponding travel time would not be representative for a
shorter piece of road.
</p>

<h2>I have noticed erroneous NPMRDS attributes such as a road name (road) or functional class (f_system) how can I get them changed?</h2>
<p>
TMC attributes are derived from the underlying HPMS Shapefile and the TMC Shapefile attribute data. The first 19-20 attributes (depending on how data is downloaded) in the
TMC_Identification file are from the TMC Shapefile and the remaining attributes are from the HPMS Shapefile. If the erroneous attribute feature is from the HPMS Shapefile a correction needs
to be requested with FHWA's Highway System Performance Division through your state FHWA representative or however your agency submits HPMS data. If the attribute is from the TMC Shapefile a
request for correction needs to be submitted to <a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a> so it can be submitted to the appropriate agency for update. If the attribute is
correct in both the applicable HPMS and TMC Shapefiles but the NPMRDS TMC_Identification &amp; NPMRDS Shapefile is incorrect, then a conflation correction needs to made, address this to the
<a href="mailto:npmrds@ritis.org">npmrds@ritis.org</a> email.

<h2>What are the implications of backfill data for March 28, 2020 through March 31, 2020?</h2>
<p>
While the outage disrupted the normal collection of data between March 28, 2020 and March 31, 2020, we were able to pull from secondary source data generally used to fill gaps in coverage.
This secondary source provided significant backfill data for this date range. For this time period, users will see degraded, or an absence, of freight data. Additionally, due to the
geographical coverage of the secondary source, users will see a shift in volume data that favors non-interstate TMCs over interstate TMCs, which is notable for March 28, 2020 to March 31,
2020.

<h1>NPMRDS Map Conflation</h1>
<p>The NPMRDS map is updated annually to reflect changes and corrections in the NHS road network, as well as updated HPMS data.
    Once this map update is finalized for each calendar year, shapefiles and NPMRDS data suitable for that year's MAP-21 calculations are available.
    A detailed technical description of the conflation process is available <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/static/help/docs/Conflation%20Guide.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>2022 Conflation Complete</h2>
<p>We have released the 2022 NPMRDS map conflation. You can now download NPMRDS 2022 data from the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/download/" target="_blank">Massive Data Downloader </a> and shapefiles from the <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/shapefiles" target="_blank">NPMRDS Shapefiles page</a>.</p>
