This is a demo of the RITIS chatbot - alpha version. The basic features are as follows:
<ul>
<li>It uses GPT-4 to answer questions (to be changed).
<li>It uses the descriptions from <a href="https://ritis.org/tools#launchpad">RITIS tools</a> as well as <a href="https://pda.ritis.org/suite/help/">Ritis help></a> to answer questions.
<li>I did not implement the memory yet - every question is treated as a new question.
</ul>
